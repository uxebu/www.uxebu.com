<p class="p1"><i>“Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you&#8217;re gonna get.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><div class="clearboth"></div><div class="demo-sep sep-none" style="margin-top:20px;"></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I like this quote, I always did (and the movie too!). It involves uncertainty and food, both common threads of my life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This time I probably chose the best chocolate I could imagine (which in real life would be white chocolate with hazelnut mousse-filling, if anyone was wondering). Seriously, I have been so lucky. uxebu made my year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My writing-through-metaphors skills didn’t obviously improve, but there’s lots more that did. If I step back for a second and think of what I’ve learned and what have changed during this year at uxebu, I can hardly believe it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I joined uxebu 12 months ago as a marketing intern. I didn’t know that much about online-marketing, even less about the start-up environment. I was pretty sure that Java was the lazy contraction of JavaScript, that was the level. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">uxebu taught me a lot. The amount of marketing-related stuff that I learned in just 1 year is really amazing, though I gained much more than that (…such as weight &#8211; thanks Weißwurst! &#8211; but that’s another story).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12 months with smiles, new people, fun, beers. I met inspiring people with amazing personalities, and I had the chance to travel a lot, visiting capital cities that I never saw before. This year was memorable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Special mention goes to Wolfram: a mentor, a teacher, a friend, a snack-fellow. Thank you for all this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m now living in The Netherlands, and my uxebu-adventure is therefore coming to an end. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A big thanks also goes to the <a href="http://jscoderetreat.com/">JSCR</a>, the people involved in this event were awesome! To every single sponsor, helper, facilitator, co-organiser, and a special thanks to the attendees. I definitely met some awesome people there <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Italian there is a better word to say “goodbye!”, which is “arrivederci”. I like it most because it literally means “good bye” and “see you soon” at the same time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is exactly my mood: a heartfelt thank you uxebus, goodbye, and see you soon!</span></p>

<p>Yes, the CodeRetreat goes global again! On the 15th of November hundreds of cities will be rocking the coding scene, joining the CodeRetreat from all over the world… which is absolutely amazing! And, of course, such an event couldn&#8217;t come without Munich, AKA Europe’s main tech hub, taking part to it <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px;"> Check the <a title="GDCR" href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org" target="_blank">official GDCR website</a> for more infos and a complete list of cities joining.</span></p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>A CodeRetreat is a day-long free event focusing on practicing Test-Driven Development (with its red-green-refactor cycle), giving the opportunity to get familiar with quality and clean code. This isn’t a conference! Rules are totally different, attendees take actively part to the coding experience: act a lot, listen very little.<br />
The Global CodeRetreat is going to work as a <a title="CodeRetreat" href="http://coderetreat.org/" target="_blank">standard one</a>, with sessions, katas and constrictions. No big difference with the usual day schedule.<br />
(&#8230;wondering how a usual day schedule looks like? Have a look <a title="JSCR how it works" href="http://jscoderetreat.com/howitworks.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
<p>This event welcomes experienced programmers as well as beginners. <strong>All programming languages</strong> are going to be involved, this meaning that if you&#8217;re able to code in at least one language of your choice that&#8217;s enough to join us!</p>
<h2>What to bring?</h2>
<p>Just your laptop, nothing more. Drinks, breakfast and lunch will be provided by sponsors.</p>
<h2>Who is facilitating?</h2>
<p>Two very well-known names, <a title="Sebastian Benz" href="https://twitter.com/sebabenz?lang=it" target="_blank">Sebastian Benz</a> (E.S.R. Labs) and <a title="Wolfram Kriesing" href="https://twitter.com/wolframkriesing?lang=it" target="_blank">Wolfram Kriesing</a> (uxebu GmbH) are going to facilitate the Munich event.</p>
<h2>Time and Location?</h2>
<p>Join us at E.S.R.Labs, in St.-Martin-Straße 53 (<a title="map GDCR location" href="https://goo.gl/maps/DHR2u" target="_blank">see map</a>) on the 15th of November 2014 (Saturday, as usual) from 8:15 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
<h2>Is registration important?</h2>
<p>YES, indeed. Take a second to register <a title="Registration" href="http://www.eventbrite.de/e/global-day-of-coderetreat-munich-edition-tickets-13740298603" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. There are only few spots left, hurry up!</p>
<p>See you at the Global Day of CodeRetreat, always looking forward to TDD the shame out of codes <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know the JS CodeRetreat from its birth, and I’m really happy and proud to see how fast it is evolving.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thank you :’)</h2>
<p>Here we are again, the JavaScript CodeRetreat #2 just ended, and was awesome!</p>
<p><strong>This time 4 cities joined: Munich, Cologne, Barcelona and Oxford! How cool is this? We’re getting bigger and bigger, that’s amazing <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></strong></p>
<p>First of all, I really want to thank our Munich sponsors: <a title="uxebu GmbH" href="http://uxebu.com" target="_blank"><strong>uxebu GmbH</strong></a> (breakfast and organisation), <a title="Mayflower" href="http://www.mayflower.de/de" target="_blank"><strong>MayFlower</strong></a> (drinks), <a title="TNG" href="http://www.tngtech.com" target="_blank"><strong>TNG Technology Consultant</strong></a> (food) and <a title="WERK1 Muenchen" href="http://www.werk1muenchen.de" target="_blank"><strong>WERK1 Muenchen</strong></a> (location). We also had media partners such as <a title="WebStorm" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank"><strong>WebStorm</strong></a> (who gave away one of their licenses… eheh, lucky Lilia!) and <a title="JS Day Verona" href="http://2014.jsday.it" target="_blank"><strong>JS Day</strong></a>, Italy. It’s a free event, but without sponsors nothing could have happened, so big thanks to everyone!!</p>
<p>Furthermore, <span style="color: #fa040e;"><strong>a big hug to all the attendees</strong></span>: as I always say, all this wouldn’t be worth it without you. You all contributed to make this event an extra-ordinary experience! We had lots of feedback, and people attending were really pleased of the result <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> overall, on a scale from one to five, we scored 4,4. I think this is great <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> there’s still space for improvement, that’s for sure. E.g., people had some problems with their keyboard settings, and some of them were also suggesting to give more space to the introduction, as the most of the attendees had absolutely no clue of  TDD and the testing world :). We’ll keep everything in mind for the next one! We’re organising this every 3 months, but due to the fact that in 3 months will be August, I guess we’re moving the next one to the beginning of September. Soon we’ll give you more details regarding the date, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There’s only one issue that bothers me&#8230;</h2>
<p>&#8230;the showing up rate.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, this kind of event works much better if there are just 20-40 people, as we can give the right attention to everyone: it’s not a conference, people have to learn while having fun, and we want to be of assistance to every single participant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several organisational aspects that are strictly connected to the number of registrations we had on MeetUp and Lanyrd. Stuff such as food, drinks, snacks, blocks, pens, etc… those are all things that we need to buy in advance, in order to be sure to satisfy everyone during the event. That said, if lots of people don’t show up, we obviously waste money and time. That’s not polite at all… I mean, it’s a free event, so obviously people are more likely to decide last minute if they’ll actually attend or not. But because this is a free event, that still requires lots of money and effort, I believe that updating the status from “yes, I come” to “no, I won’t come” would be at least a nice and respectful thing to do. Same issue in all the locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, at the end everything was absolutely fine, people were happy of their learnings and pleased of the overall experience, so that’s the most important thing! I’m so excited to help organising this regularly <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> it’s really a cool event both to organise and join.</p>
<p>Thanks to the sponsors, thanks to all the attendees, and thanks to uxebu for making this happen again!!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soooo many people are asking us which skills and abilities a facilitator should have. Here we are then, with a small list of suggestions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>General skills</h2>
<p>First of all, he/she (probably “he”…) should be able to speak in public, trying to give a personal touch to every talk. He (I’ll just continue assuming that the facilitator will be a man… but come on women, we are just a few, but I’m sure we can be as good as men! (Probably better <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> ))… should obviously be a JavaScript developer, as this event is completely focused on JS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Technical skills</h2>
<p>He should know TDD well enough to give the introduction talk, therefore he should know how TDD works not only in a theoretical way, but especially from the practical point of view. He should have attended at least 1 or 2 CodeRetreats in order to know how this kind of event works and how it evolves during the day. He should know and have experienced pair programming. He should have watched Corey Haine’s <a title="Corey Heines-introduction to CodeRetreats" href="http://vimeo.com/18955165" target="_blank">introduction video</a>. He should feel safe enough with his expertise to ask deep questions to the attendees, and he should be good enough in understanding people’s code in just a few minutes, challenging them and suggesting them solutions and hints. Finally, he should have exercised the Game of Life at least a couple of times. And, last but absolutely not least, he should show the passion for what he does, conveying emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Run retrospective</h2>
<p>He should be able to come up with an idea on how to run a retrospective (for inspiration, take a look <a title="retrospective tips" href="http://www.funretrospectives.com" target="_blank">here</a>), and he should be able to lead the closing circle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Final suggestions</h2>
<p>Finally, I highly recommend you to give a look to the main CodeRetreat website, in the “<a title="Facilitating-CodeRetreat.org" href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating" target="_blank">Facilitating</a>” section.</p>
<p>As usual, if you need more information or suggestions just ping us! <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>If you wish, you can always ask us to be your facilitators in your city, covering at least travel costs and accommodation (you can look for a sponsor for that for sure! <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ). We are also available for internal workshops.</p>
<p>If you are willing to host a JS CodeRetreat in your city, take a look at <a title="how to host jscoderetreat in your city" href="http://uxebo.com/blog/2014/03/04/how-to-host-a-js-coderetreat-in-your-city/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“<em>We have a really good idea about developing a new web product.</em>”</strong></p>
<p>Usually, this is what we actually think, but in the sentence there is a huge mistake: “a really good idea”. No. It’s not necessarily a good idea! I read countless forums, articles, stories about failure in startups. Too many! But the most of them have a similar basic structure: a brilliant idea, a great product, a cutting-edge technology, an experienced team. And yet they fail. How is it possible?</p>
<p>I assume for sure that those startups actually have a forefront technology and a skilled team. The hardest part is connecting the “brilliant idea” with the “great product” in a logical way.<br />
Normally in startups we get excited quite quickly: “new product? Yess! Let’s do it! Let’s invest all our money, time and effort…we believe it will be a success!”<br />
…<strong>WRONG</strong>!<br />
Due to their trust in a technology’s, product’s or service’s superiority, many startups fail to spend enough time exploring alternative business models.<br />
The aim is to find the best and more scalable technology and product, therefore also startup’s ideas should have a referring business model! Seems to be something theoretical and difficult, boring and useless.<br />
Normally it could be but, believe me, for startups it’s not! (PS: actually, we’re not a startup anymore, but still our small and dynamic business well relates to many startup business models :))</p>
<p>An innovative idea usually leads to a product, very far from being a “great” product. This could probably end with being new, innovative, and potentially a success. The key word here is “potentially”. How to be sure that we can get rid of that adverb?</p>
<p>Well, we’ll obviously never be sure, but we can still try to do things in a more conscious way <strong>JUST ASKING</strong>! It’s so simple…<br />
Ask your consumers what they think about that new product: would they use it? Would they pay for it? What’s wrong with it? Could it be improved? Etc… But be careful: questions have to be well structured! Never ask “would you use it?”. That’s an hypothetical question, it makes no statistic sense. (I’ll explain better how to create a good questionnaire in the next blog post :))<br />
Seems simple, but it’s not. Very often startups don’t even know who exactly their users are. Identifying the customer should be the “step 1”, before everything else. And, we know, sometimes it’s not simple at all. How is it possible not to know at least which is your consumer?<br />
Well, take Uxebu as an example: in our company, we (actually, they) are great web development consultants. We were thinking about launching a new product/service on the market, a very technical product, intended for expert programmers. Basically, a niche product. At the beginning, the “expert programmers” were our target clients. But it is perhaps too generic? Of course it is! Which exactely are our customers? What jobs are they really trying to get done? Are there enough potential customers to let our business grow? Do they have buying power? How can we reach them?<br />
Defining all this is the first step to define the specific market in which you are going to operate. The most obvious advice is: <strong>sit down and brainstorm</strong>. Who could take advantage of our products? Computer Science students? Yes. Of every country in the world? Yes. And Professors? Yes. CTOs? Of course. And so forth, until you have a complete list of ALL of those that could be potential clients. The more specific the better!</p>
<p>…And now what?</p>
<p>And now start with your business model! Before even thinking of preparing a questionnaire for our customers, we structured our own <strong>Validation Board</strong>, one of the core tools for startups who want to innovate. It’s quick, simple and effective, and it also opens up your mind, helping to think constructively. Interested? In the next blog post we’ll explain you how we are using it: in our case it is turning out to be absolutely crucial! In the meanwhile, have a look at <a title="Test driven: why not?" href="http://www.slideshare.net/irenella89/test-driven-why-not" target="_blank">these slides</a>, relating to a short talk I gave during the <a title="Lean Startup meetup Munich" href="http://www.meetup.com/Lean-Startup-Munich/" target="_blank">Lean Startup meetup in Munich</a><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“Knowledge sharing”</strong>: even though I’m getting used to this mindset, this is something that still surprises me quite a lot.<br />
Our JS CodeRetreat was all about sharing: we shared our TDD knowledge, giving you all the chance to attend a free course for an entire day, and you shared your experience and much more during the retrospective moments.<br />
The aim of this blogpost is, again, to share all the opinions, emotions, information and tools collected during the event.</p>
<p><a href="http://uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-08-18_Fotor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3851" src="http://uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-08-18_Fotor-300x218.jpg" alt="2014-02-08 18_Fotor" width="300" height="218" /></a><span id="more-3855"></span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>MY PERSONAL OPINION?</h3>
<p>Yes, I think it’s right to put my personal opinion before the paragraph regarding the actual learnings you gained. I&#8217;m not self-centered, the fact is that the “human touch” really was an important aspect of our JS CodeRetreat, and it would be a shame not to talk about it. I learned a lot, but nothing regarding coding. As I mentioned you all at the beginning, “I’m Irene, I work at Uxebu, and I don’t know how to code”. Despite this, the JS CodeRetreat was a very formative and enjoyable experience for me too! I really think that this event gave a lot to everyone, and not only relating to coding improvements (although I have LOTS of material confirming that you were quite pleased with your coding learnings too… but let’s wait for the next paragraph for this!).</p>
<p>Many people and their reactions gave me positive feelings. Just to give a couple of samples, Francis, this amazing guy from San Francisco/ Spain/ Philippine/ wherever: crazy, both in clothing and in the approach <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> really a happy guy, was able to give a “personal touch” in each retrospective. Was a pleasure to meet such a positive person! And Georg… I know him quite well, but this time he also made his contribution to the human side of the event, by asking to many people suggestions for his bachelor’s thesis (regarding TDD, obviously :)).<br />
Another person who has left a mark? Irishka, and not only because we have the same beautiful name :). She was the only woman at the event. She is a young mother-programmer, the first one I met up to now (actually, she is the first female-developer I ever met at all!!). A very nice and spontaneous girl, always smiley and kind. It’s a mystery how someone so calm can also be a programmer <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> I could keep on saying something about each of you, but I’ll continue just boring myself writing about you in my personal diary ;). A special thanks goes to the guys that stayed there helping in cleaning and tidying up. Not only for the cleaning part, but especially for the great night we enjoyed all together! An unexpected but really fun evening, I also learned a lot about vegans: I&#8217;ll never be vegan, that&#8217;s for sure, but it still was a very interesting conversation.</p>
<p>About the organisation, I was quite proud of it, except for the pizza delivery… no more ordering from Pizza Mamma Mia (come on fellows! More than 1h delay in pizza delivery is unbelievable). Sure, there still are lots of things we could improve, as buying Club Mate for everyone (in my opinion, the least attractive drink in the world, but you all love it so much!! Next time you’ll have it, I swear :)). People want it so much, a guy also brought his own… we definitely need to provide that next time. And what about Haribo? I think that Haribo tastes even worse than Club Mate… but you were all eating them, you finished almost 2 giant boxes! On the one hand I don’t understand you, on the other hand I admire you: programmers sometimes are a group so different from all the other human beings, but in their diversity they are all quite similar, and a proof is that they all have the same ugly tastes <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> but don’t worry, I’m learning your tastes, and we’ll provide everything for the <strong>next event (<a href="http://jscoderetreat.com/2/" target="_blank">10th of May!</a>).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?</h3>
<p>A lot. Thanks to you and to your countless post-it pasted all over the wall. The event was divided into 5 sessions, and after each session we had a retrospective moment, during which each of you shared his own opinions, ideas and possible improvements of the just ended session. We collected all of them, and after reading them we were even more proud of our event: you were all so pleased!! Thank you <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> (but, I have to say, for a -short- while I haven’t considered you nice people: summing up your post-it was absolutely nerve wracking. Next time only CAP letters, please!! :D)<br />
Anyway, I could briefly summarize your comments, dividing them into opinions, remarks and outbursts (due to the lack of space I’ll not list every single post-it… too many :))</p>
<p><em>[Look at how your comments evolved during the day!]<br />
</em>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&gt;<br />
<a href="http://uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Document2...jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3843" src="http://uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Document2...jpg" alt="post-it sum up" width="1066" height="1445" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the day you all suggested lots of</p>
<h3>TOOLS</h3>
<p>. Here’s the list!</p>
<p>• Codacy.com<br />
• Tddbin.com<br />
• Grunt<br />
• Gulp<br />
• Plato<br />
• Codewars.com (not a tool but worth it)<br />
• iTerm 2 (Terminal replacement for Mac OS X)<br />
• Currently (Google Chrome extension for weather)<br />
• Codeclimate for codestats<br />
• Unix Command (grep -rn &#8220;search term&#8221; directory/from/here)<br />
• Floobits.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CAN WE IMPROVE?</h3>
<p>Sure! It’s always possible to improve. It’s clear, we were all very happy about everything, but mostly because it was our first JS CodeRetreat. Over time it will improve more and more, both in the content and in the organisational point of view. We had various improvement suggestions, for example the (too) long closing moment, the starting time (this is something that really tormented your souls <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> next time we’ll think of a possible solution!), or the lack of cigarette breaks… all issues that we’ll keep in mind for the future improvements!<br />
Other suggestions were to provide international keyboards (why didn’t we think about it? You’re so right!!), make the first session with “no conditions AT ALL” (true), and finally make videos of the retrospective moments… actually, I don’t say anything to avoid bad luck, but maybe for the next event we’ll have a surprise about the video equipment <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> we’ll see, stay tuned! We have many further ideas of how to improve and become better and better, but if you want to suggest us something else, just leave a comment, a tweet, or whatever you prefer <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Again (and again, and again…), THANK YOU for this great experience, and hope to see you all the <strong><a href="http://jscoderetreat.com/2/" target="_blank">10th of May!</a></strong> <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The aim of this blogpost is to encourage and help those of you who are willing to <strong>host a JS CodeRetreat in your city</strong>. I’m pretty sure that lots of people thought “nice idea! I’d like to take part to it…but where to start?”. It’s simple. Requires some energy and effort to organise it but, believe me, it’s totally worth it. And you will be rewarded with a great feeling of satisfaction! (and we’ll help you too, that’s for sure!)</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1>Why is it important?</h1>
<p>Don’t worry, I’m not here to explain for the thousandth time <a href="http://jscoderetreat.com">“what’s a JS CodeRetreat”</a>: you can find lots of information on the <a href="http://jscoderetreat.com">official website</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=coderetreat">twitter</a>, on <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/2014/02/11/js-coderetreat-our-successful-event/">other</a> <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/2014/01/16/our-mindmap/">uxebu</a> <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/2014/01/15/day-1-how-to-organize-an-event-day-by-day/">blogposts</a>, <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/2014/01/14/how-to-organize-an-event-day-by-day-our-js-coderetreat/">etc.</a></p>
<p>But why is it important to host this event in your city too?</p>
<p>There are so many reasons that it’s really quite difficult to create a list. First of all, this isn’t a conference, it’s a CodeRetreat! Rules are totally different, attendees take actively part in the coding experience: act a lot, listen very little. In a conference you are mostly sitting and listening to talks. Besides the chatting in the breaks the activity is up to the speaker. In a CodeRetreat you hack and you actively share what you have learned after every session (of 45min) and the facilitator actually speaks very little compared to all the attendees.</p>
<p>Secondly, although the purpose of this event is NOT AT ALL advertising your company, you’ll still have a lot of visibility, and people will get to know your company as “THE company hosting the JS CodeRetreat”. Believe me, for us this has been a great jump forward in spreading what we do daily. Testing and TDD are not yet widespread practices, but they should be, and with this event you’ll have the chance to communicate it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Wheretostart"></a></p>
<h1>Where to start?</h1>
<p><strong>First step is to <a href="http://jscoderetreat.com/2/city/new.html">add your city to the official JS CodeRetreat website</a>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-04-02-at-15.03.51.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4319" src="http://uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-04-02-at-15.03.51-1024x435.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-02 at 15.03.51" width="1024" height="435" /></a></p>
<p>After that, where exactly are you going to host your event? This is a crucial point: you need a hall big enough to contain <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/119361579@N03/12925347443/">all the people you expect, tables, chairs, etc.</a>, and there should still be a free space where to eat and hold all your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/119361579@N03/12925375833/">“retrospectives”</a> (I’ll explain you what’s this about in a sec). The hall should have enough plug-ins (though you can still buy spare ones), and it has to provide a good wifi connection, adequate for fullfilling the wifi needs of all your attendees.</p>
<p>You’ll need projectors (min. 1, but if we planned a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/119361579@N03/12925329613/">“Randori”</a> in the timetable, you’ll need one every 10/13 expected people) and microphones (better if wifi), both usually available in many halls. If not, keep in mind that projectors and microphones are crucial, therefore you should start looking for them asap :).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Howtopayforit"></a></p>
<h1>How to pay for it? Sponsoring.</h1>
<p>Look for sponsors. This is the best way, and you’ll both take advantage from your JS CodeRetreat event (your names will be everywhere!). You’ll need sponsors at least for the hall/location, the food and the drinks. In my opinion, the best way to find sponsors is simply going to other events that you might be interested in (MeetUp.com is full of stuff), and talk to people during breaks or spare time. Really, believe me, there are lots of people looking for events to sponsor, sometime the most simple thing to do is the one that would never come into your mind! Attending events organized by other companies could be a great opportunity to find new sponsor. (And to increase your personal culture. There are so many awesome and interesting events around you, maybe you don’t even know!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Howtopromoteit"></a></p>
<h1>How to promote it?</h1>
<p>Remember: this is not advertisment! Your name will be everywhere, that’s for sure, but you still don’t have to advertise your company, but the event! It’s quite different…. There is a code of conduct that has to be <a href="http://coderetreat.org/hosting">respected</a>.<br />
Create your event on <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>, <a href="http://lanyrd.com">lanyrd.com</a>, Facebook, sponsor it with your twitter page, post it and share it with all the JS groups and people you think could be interested. We can help you by advertising it on the <a href="http://twitter.com/jscoderetreat">official JS CodeRetreat twitter page</a>, on the <a href="http://jscoderetreat.com">main website</a>, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Whatwillineed"></a></p>
<h1>What will I need?</h1>
<p>Besides what I’ve already mentioned (projectors, microphone, extension chords, etc.) you’ll need some extra stuff to make sure your event will be designed in detail and, therefore, awesome.</p>
<p>First of all, you’ll need <strong>food</strong>.Sponsors are paying for that, but you still have to buy it, and therefore you should think in advance of what to buy and how much to buy. You need to provide breakfast, lunch, snacks, coffee, milk and drinks. As an example, for our JS CodeRetreat that took place on the 8th of February, we bought: coffee (we had the machine), milk and sugar, lots of different types of biscuits, yogurt, butter bretzel, chips, haribo, beers, coke, juice and other soft drinks, and pizza for lunch. You’ll obviously need cups, glasses, plates and cutlery too! Don’t forget to think of the obvious stuff :).</p>
<p>You’ll then need some <strong>stationery items</strong>: coloured markers, adhesive labels to use as name tags, lots of coloured post-its (you’ll need them for the retrospective moment), note pads and pens. My suggestion, after having seen <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/119361579@N03/12925637444/">how useful pens and blocks</a> were in our previous event, is to make some gadgets to give away after the event. Best idea is to create note pads and pens/pencils, but also cups could be a great idea! Those are the most comon gadgets but, I have to say, the most useful too! Everyone can use them during the event, and then bring everything back home or in their offices <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> We also created energy drinks with our logo, stickers and an awesome poster regarding TDD: all objects that the attendees seemed to like quite a lot, therefore I suggest you to do the same!</p>
<p>We’ll provide you the <strong>slides</strong>, that will work as a guideline for your event speakers, so you don’t have to think to much of what to talk about… you won’t be talking that much though, the goal is to make your partecipants learn something modern, useful and new… they’ll act the most of the time, not listen :).</p>
<p>Another suggestion is to provide some <strong>international keyboards</strong>: we didn’t think of it, but we saw that many people wasted time just setting international keyboards on their laptops, therefore providing them would give an extra edge to your event.<br />
Until the next event we will have <a href="http://tddbin.com">tddbin.com</a> ready to be used in pairs, so you can just use your laptop and the environment you are used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="whatisretrospective"></a></p>
<h1>What’s this “retrospective”?</h1>
<p>This is the most awesome part of the event. After each session, you will all meet together in another side of the hall, and your speakers will ask some more deep questions about the just ended session. You can’t believe how much you’ll come to learn by doing this! You should also find a system to summarize all the informations, suggestions and opinions: we thought of hanging <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/119361579@N03/12925374603/">sheets with the sessions on the wall, and everyone just attached their opinion under them on a post it</a>. Considering that this is the core moment of all the event, and that we learned a lot just listening to the attendees speaking, for the next time we decided to make some videos of the retrospective, and I suggest you to do the same. It’s really a formative moment for everyone, don’t miss the opportunity to remember it in the best possible way! Videos, records, post-its, pics… do as much as possible so as not to miss anything. <strong>The retrospectives will give you lots of satisfaction, I swear.</strong></p>
<p>Btw, pics and videos are important during the whole event (a good smartphone could be enough). These will be useful not only to remember this great experience in details, but also for your social media contents, for promoting it the next time, and for your sponsors too: they’ll probably ask for proof that their logo was present during the event, remember this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="whatuxebuprovides"></a></p>
<h1>What uxebu provides?</h1>
<p>We help you with the sponsoring and promoting stuff, we provide you the slides for the event (a big help for your speakers!), we’ll give you the timetable, with the chosen kata and a detailed description of what will happen during every session and during the whole day. If you still feel not prepared enough on the topic, we can send you some links to videos, blog articles and other stuff regarding the carrying out of the CodeRetreats. Obviously, if you need more informations, we’re here to help you, therefore just get in touch with one of us!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="anotherdate"></a></p>
<h1>What if I want to host a JS CodeRetreat in my city, but not during the global date?</h1>
<p>You can certainly do that! It’s a community event, you can host one whenever you prefer (though hosting it during the global date gives to the event another feeling). We can help you too, just get in contact with us and let’s see what we could do together!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="companycoderetreat"></a></p>
<h1>A company CodeRetreat?</h1>
<p>Well, if you’re interested, uxebu provides intensive internal trainings, that could last 1 or 2 days, according to the number of attendees and on your JavaScript level. We can reach you wherever you are, <a href="mailto:contact+uxebu-blog@uxebu.com?subject=Company%20CodeRetreat%20or%20Training">just ping us</a> if your company wants to learn more about JS tests, TDD, clean code, and much more ;).</p>
<p>I hope that this (loooong!!!) blog post will facilitate the hosting of your JS CodeRetreat. For further questions, again, feel super free to ask us!</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

<p>Here we are, our event recently ended, and I’m here to draw some conclusions.<br />
I have to say, we are extremely pleased with the result! It took a considerable time to organise everything, but it was totally worth it! We obviously had sponsors: thanks to <a href="http://www.mayflower.de/de" target="_blank">Mayflower</a> for the food, to <a href="http://www.elance.com" target="_blank">Elance</a> for the drinks and to <a href="http://www.werk1muenchen.de" target="_blank">WERK1</a> for the location. I’ll discuss the event in more detail in a second blog post (including a list of the tools you suggested too!), here I only want to….ehm, well, basically I only want to thank all the participants: it’s thanks to them that the event was so gorgeous!<br />
<span id="more-3111"></span></p>
<h3>What was it about?</h3>
<p>A JS CodeRetreat is a a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design.<br />
Basically, this event gives the opportunity to practice TDD, Clean Code and Refactoring for a whole day. The main difference between the CodeRetreat and our JS CodeRetreat is that normally you can use different programming languages, instead we decided to use only JavaScript, therefore this was a more focused CodeRetreat.</p>
<p>More than 80 attendees used <a href="http://www.tddbin.com"><strong>TDDbin</strong></a> (basically all of the people without a JavaScript testing environment). This is an Uxebu product, released only the night before the event&#8230; we had lots of positive feedback for TDDbin too!! So happy <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
This time Madrid and Valencia joined too (we were 100 people totally!), and for the next time we already have requests from other countries!!! This is so awesome <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Considering the fact that we’ve had many positive feedback, we decided that, from now on, <strong>this is going to be a regular event, probably taking place every 3 months</strong> or so (the next one is already fixed for the 10th OF MAY!).</p>
<p><strong><em>Ok, I’ll stop being boring and lengthy…</em></strong> want to see some pics? Want to get an idea of the amount of tweets regarding us and you all? Here you are!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first days as an intern at uxebu were hilarious… yes, hilarious for everyone but me: I didn’t get half of their laughs and furrowed eyebrows. Sometimes they were just looking at me astonished and baffled. Now, in retrospect, I can understand why.</p>
<p>I am a stranger in a foreign country, and, although Italy isn’t so far away from here, we are two very different people: we are in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics)">PIGS</a>, they are Germany. According to the modern economic literature, we are the boorish, they are the cool and efficient ones.</p>
<p>When I first arrived at uxebu, I really wanted to give a good impression: I wanted them to see that I’m a smart and polite person, no way related to the messy-Berlusconi-bunga bunga Italians (note: I didn’t say I didn’t wanted to be related to a pig; considering the industrial amount of food that I steadily devour, that would be impossible).<br />
<span id="more-3012"></span></p>
<h2>Trust me</h2>
<p>At the beginning, relatively to the fact of being polite, I asked for permission every time before going to the bathroom, before having a coffee, before everything… and that is where I started to see the first furrowed eyebrows: “sure you can!”; “why are you asking?” …… “STOP ASKING! You can do whatever you want”.</p>
<p><a href="http://v2.uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/poker-face.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3018" src="http://v2.uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/poker-face-300x266.png" alt="poker-face" width="300" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, whatever. <strong>In this startup environment, basically everything works trusting each other</strong>. I wasn’t used to all this. Trust has to be gained, it’s not a right! Instead here things work the opposite way round: they trust in you as long as you deserve it. Trust concerns to most of the working relationships, everyday and in every situation.</p>
<p>And with regard to altruism? I remember when my boyfriend came to Munich to visit me. In order to see him asap, I really wanted to ask my colleagues if I could leave work half an hour before the usual time. But at the end I didn’t. I thought that the justification of my boyfriend visiting me wasn’t a good enough reason to leave earlier.<br />
When they found out that he was coming, they told me out of their own volition “you should go home earlier today!”.<br />
I could keep going on telling you more and more, but as you saw I don’t have the gift of synthesis, so better if I stop here with the examples.</p>
<p>I guess for some of you this working mindset and behaviors are completely normal, but I’m pretty sure that others are thinking “wow, lucky girl!”. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>“The psychology of work”&#8230;</h2>
<p>While I was thinking about all this, I was reminded of an exam, the course’s name was “The psychology of work”&#8230; I know what you’re thinking … “that’s bullshit”. Basically you’re right, that was the typical exam after which you had the highest score ensured, therefore it was very popular. However, some of the contents were very interesting. Everything revolved around the fact of trusting the employees, being this a way to make them feel valued and respected, and by acting in this way probably the productivity at work would have increased.</p>
<p>What already bothered me at that time was that such a simple and obvious concept was instead so difficult to apply to the real life.</p>
<p>I constantly talk with people totally dissatisfied with their workplace, and the most of the reasons relate to the behavior of their bosses towards them: strong hierarchies, useless formalisms, overly strict rules of obedience to the chiefs. I mean, respect and obedience are totally fine, and in larger companies hierarchies are almost a must (trouble if not!). What I really don’t fully understand are excesses. Why? Where is the advantage of forcing people to dress in an overly formal manner? Why people aren’t allowed to have the freedom to act and think in the way that best suits them? Why don’t they realize that unhappy people work worse? (And, let&#8217;s face it, sooner or later dissatisfied people are going to speak badly of their working place, which certainly does not help the company’s image).</p>
<p>Perhaps startups exceed on the opposite side. But, know what? It’s completely granted to them. They are usually young, self-made, cool, working with friends in a co-working space. They can decide how to shape their one business as they prefer.</p>
<p>Startups are a world apart, unique and incomparable. But I still think that each of us has a lot to learn from them, both in the private life and in the businesses.<br />
<strong>Trust</strong> should be the foundation on which to build our lives.<br />
Obvious? Yes, Nevertheless….</p>
