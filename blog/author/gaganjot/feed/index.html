				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!! Myself Gaganjot, am a student of Informatics in TU Munich. I joined Uxebu as a software developer (working student), having motivation and enthusiasm to work in Web Development.</p>
<h2>While in Uxebu</h2>
<p>When I started I was a novice to <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>, which was at the core of Uxebu. But having the confidence to learn it and later realising that Uxebu has bunch of great developers with whom I will be working along, I was quickly into somewhat &#8216;professional&#8217; web-development (compared to only having done small University projects).</p>
<p>During my first task only, I learnt many tools and techniques which are used in today&#8217;s software industry. The most important thing, which is very important in success of every startup is its work culture. And talking about Uxebu, I must say that how it should be; because having regular contact and communication with other members of the company is as important as having good product/service.<br />
I also came to know about the difference between ONLY WRITING the code and WRITING the code. And I could sense the analogy between Uxebu&#8217;s coding practises and the following quotation:<br />
&#8220;Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. -Martin Fowler&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-2839"></span></p>
<p>I came to know that how your work could be beneficial to others if written abiding certain pre-decided rules (like committing code often, better renaming, modularising, refactoring, writing simple-small-dedicated functions to be reused, etc) and that is what I think high quality development is, writing code which is more understandable, manageable and easily-maintainable, which doesn&#8217;t need any documentation (at-least for developers).<br />
Being a working student I didn&#8217;t spend my major time in company, but then also the time which I spend here is worth value for a student having software-development (after sometime I would say writing quality software) as a long-term goal. For putting this into habit, we regularly have coding-dojo sessions at the start of the day. Having Coding Dojo was a completely new experience for me, where I learnt about the <a href="http://www.cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs121/supp/williams_prpgm.pdf" target="_blank">pair-programming</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf" target="_blank">code calisthenics</a>, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/code-smells.html" target="_blank">avoiding code-smells</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring" target="_blank">refactoring</a>.<br />
This is not all which I have to tell, as the main organ of Uxebu quality-development is something else. This was <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html" target="_blank">TDD (Test Driven Development)</a>, which initially sounds to me really crazy until I knew the essence of it. After having seen TDD used in some of the projects and then putting TDD into practise I realised what is meant by maintainable software, how TDD can be used to validate the code and then, not the last, but TDD deriving the design of the software too.</p>
<p>Putting it altogether, it was a great experience being in Uxebu and working in Germany.</p>
