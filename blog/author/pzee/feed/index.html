				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While we wait for some resources to clear before releasing our demo game, King of War, let me give you a sneak preview by releasing the physics engine that&#8217;s at the core of it.</p>
<p>The physics of the game basically require a plane (2d area) with circles that can collide. I&#8217;ve considered using <a href="http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/">box2d</a> or related libraries, but as usual decided to do it myself. In hindsight, I&#8217;m not sure whether that decision was the best. It might be, because I&#8217;m sure box2d would have given me implementation headaches as well. Regardless, I did the engine myself. Which meant diving into some hardcore math. Let me take you through it <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basics. We will have only moving circles and we&#8217;ll need to properly handle collisions. First we want to be able to detect a collision between two circles. You can do that by checking the distance between the two circles and comparing that to the sum of their radii. If the distance between their center is smaller than the sum of their radii, it must mean that they are overlapping somehow. The formula for the distance between two points is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras theorem</a> and goes like this (where A and B are your points and C is your distance):</p>
<div class="codecolorer-container text default" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;"><div class="text codecolorer" style="padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap">A^2+B^2=C^2</div></div>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/xxzY4/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2va" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>We could check for this after every frame and then try to correct for it, but why would we want to do that when we can detect collisions before they happen and act accordingly? Let&#8217;s try that route.</p>
<p>First we take a look at collision detection between two circles where one circle is idle and the other is moving on a straight path, this resembles our basic most case.</p>
<p>We have two circles, A and B. A has a speed and a course (in radians, not that it really matters). The speed is the number of pixels that A moves for each step (one game frame). Each step A moves on the line A-AA (or A-A&#8217;, but I think primes are a bit harder to detect and write in code so I&#8217;ll use AA for the end point). We want to know whether A collided with B anywhere while moving on the line A-AA.</p>
<p>To compute this we create a new circle, C. C has a radius of A.radius+B.radius and the same center as B. We can now say that A collides with B while moving on the line A-AA if and only if A-AA intersects with C anywhere (within this step, of course). Turns out there&#8217;s a pretty simple algorithm to detect this exact thing.</p>
<p>All we have to do now is to check t1 and t2. If either of them is 0&lt;=t&lt;=1, then the collision will happen this step. t1 and t2 indicate where on the line the collision occurs and where exactly, relative to the line drawn. In our case that means it starts at A and ends at AA. If the number is negative, A might collide with B if it could go exactly backwards. If either t is bigger than 1 than A might collide with B in the future, but not this step.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/3CjyK/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2vb" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>Now that we have the computation when B is idle, let&#8217;s take a look how to do it when B is also moving. Since that&#8217;s how it will be a lot of the times in the game. And I tried getting away with it but that won&#8217;t work. The problem is too obvious. So how do we do the trick above on two moving bodies instead of one?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought a bit about this but couldn&#8217;t hack it. I could only come up with extremely complex computations and formula&#8217;s. None of them were worth the trouble of even trying to implement them. The horror&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131424/pool_hall_lessons_fast_accurate_.php?page=2">found a nice little trick online</a> that worked brilliantly; You simply deduct one vector from the other and apply the above algorithm on the result. Wow! Ok, so we&#8217;ve got that to work. Now what?</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/a8grV/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2vc" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>When we know where exactly a collision occurs, we must move the stone to that position. If you do this, the stones will be touching exactly. You must then determine what they do next. What happens to the speed and course when two stones collide? After giving that some thought, I&#8217;ve concluded (and observed) that it&#8217;s actually fine and easy to simply let one stone (the slower stone) move in the original course of the faster stone (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_gas">this also helped</a>). The faster stone will start moving in a course that makes a line that&#8217;s tangent to the exact point of collision. Whether it moves left or right on that line depends on the original angle of approach. This actually works out quite well.</p>
<p>In the demo below both circles have a speed (they&#8217;ll follow their blue line at the same fixed speed). The orange line is the delta vector and we can see that a collision will occur if that orange line crosses the outer (grey) circle, just like the example above.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/RNPNK/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2ve" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>To determine the new speed of the two stones I cheated a little and add a fraction of the original speed of the faster stone to the slower stone and return the remainder to the other stone. This division also depends on the angle of approach, meaning that a stone that barely touches another stone will keep most of its velocity and only changes course slightly. A perfectly head-on collision causes the faster stone to transfer all its velocity to the other stone and become idle. The other stone will continue its path in the original course of the first stone at the same speed of the first stone. You could also play with decreasing the velocity to account for the collision itself, but I didn&#8217;t and it still looked fine to me.</p>
<p>Oh and there&#8217;s more, much more. If we take a look at an imminent high-speed collision where one of the stones will almost immediately hit another stone after the collision, we&#8217;ll see that we must take chaining collisions into account. This means that in the same step, one stone can hit multiple other stones. The thing we must prevent is that we don&#8217;t warp the stone by limitlessly moving an attacking stone adjacent to its target (as described above). In some cases this would otherwise cause the stone to warp across the screen and this feels very wrong.</p>
<p>Instead each stone will get a variable that tracks how much time it has used moving while inside a single step. For instance, if a stone would move 50 pixels this step, but it collides after moving 35 pixels, it still has 30% time left in this step. This time is then applied to the new speed and the stone is moved accordingly. At the end of the collision detection cycle, a stone will move the remaining time percentage of the speed it currently has to finish it&#8217;s move.</p>
<p>The side effect of this approach is on the one hand that the collisions look much smoother now. But it also means that collision chaining just became a heckuvalot more complex. Because now you have to keep checking for collisions and scan all the stones again after every collision. I&#8217;ve had cases where this meant considerate pauses. So it&#8217;s a good idea to arbitrarily cut this short. There&#8217;s no point in simulating 50 collisions this way. Remember that it&#8217;s all about the user. It only has to perceive to be correct.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a final demo with the entire physics engine at work.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kueMt/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve turned this engine into a plugin. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/bonsai-plugins/circle-physics">https://github.com/bonsai-plugins/circle-physics</a> and include it in your own projects. The Item class is exposed through the Phsyics constructor (so Physics.Item). I suggest subclassing that class.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I know, I know, it&#8217;s been too long since we&#8217;ve met. But let me make that up to you by this monster post. An Xmas special! Not because all the participants in this episode played nice with each other. Oh no, they most certainly did not. It&#8217;s a full out war! But more because, well, Xmas-eve is tomorrow <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> So, let&#8217;s see how threw what mud in which direction and why. </p>
<p>Mind you this is about three weeks worth of news, out of order, so some of it might be a little &#8220;old&#8221;. Then again, I guess anything in this industry is old if it didn&#8217;t happen today&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-2059"></span></p>
<p>Apple probably covers 25% of this post. So let&#8217;s start there.</p>
<p>It turns out <a href="http://www.macworld.com.au/news/apple-loses-trademark-in-china-no-longer-called-ipad-41378/">Apple does not hold rights</a> to the names iPhone and iPad and was unable to persuade a judge otherwise. That means it cannot sell their devices under those names and has to come up with new names for them. This is not just annoying for Apple, but could also have an interesting effect where it might affect the global name. I mean, if there are five bazillion devices called foo, doesn&#8217;t it make sense to rename those other few million devices to foo as well? Then again, it might give Apple the opportunity to give the device a name that&#8217;s more suiting to the Chinese language. We&#8217;ll see. For now, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/12/11/rumor-denied-apple-hasnt-got-iphone-4s-clearance-for-china-launch-yet/">the iPhone 4s isn&#8217;t even available in China</a>.</p>
<p>Apple fought a few more battles in the past few weeks. For instance, Google [<a href="http://webwereld.nl/nieuws/108828/eric-schmidt--apple-wil-consumentenkeuze-beperken.html">NL..</a>] asked the European Commission to investigate Apple for abusing patents. Of course, Google <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/google/google-faces-nine-antitrust-complaints-in-the-eu/3196">already faced these investigations themselves</a>, so I guess they knew the right people to complain to.</p>
<p>Regardless of Google&#8217;s efforts, the <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/12/06/1348253/eu-targets-apple-in-ebook-investigation">EC is targeting Apple anyways, but this time regarding ebooks</a>. They think Apple made illegal price arrangements. Who would have thought.</p>
<p>Over in Germany people might soon <a href="http://www.techworld.com.au/article/409876/german_court_issues_injunction_against_apple_products">forget about Apple</a>. Well okay, maybe not. But <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/12/09/motorola-wins-patent-suit-against-apple-in-germany-iphoneipad-to-be-banned/">the Germans be able to get their hands on an iPhone or iPad as long as this ruling stands</a>. Seems something legally backfired for them as Samsung is fine in Germany, for the moment. Although sales are fine for the moment, this is just until stock runs out (it seems).</p>
<p>Apple also struck out at the other side of the planet, where they lost a tablet case in Australia versus Samsung (who else). They won an earlier case but it got overturned and now that overturning was reconfirmed by another judge. Poor Apple.</p>
<p>I guess they thought so too because it was discovered that <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/12/10/198218/apple-transfers-patents-through-shell-company-to-sue-all-phone-makers">Apple &#8220;sold&#8221; some patents to a patent troll</a> so that it could sue pretty much any other phone manufacturer. Of course the troll never even mentions Apple in their cases. Isn&#8217;t that nice.</p>
<p>And to kick a &#8230; company when he&#8217;s down, Samsung follows up with <a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/12/samsung-hits-apple-with-four-new.html">four new lawsuits regarding patents</a>. Joy!</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t lose everything though. They won a case against HTC that&#8217;ll prevent them importing new devices starting April 2012. <a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/12/apple-wins-itc-ruling-of-narrow.html">The victory is a bit hollow</a> though since it&#8217;ll be enough for HTC to do some minor adjustments to get away with it.</p>
<p>Over at RIM things aren&#8217;t running very smooth either. They <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/12/07/1513250/rim-gives-up-after-losing-initial-battle-over-bbx-trademark%29">had to give up on the BBX</a> (&#8220;BlackBerry 10&#8243;) name for their new platform due to existing trademarks.</p>
<p>It was also report that that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/amazon-considered-acquiring-rim-over-the-summer/">Amazon</a> but also the duo of <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/microsoft-nokia-flirt-with-rim/story-fnay3ubk-1226228259341">Microsoft and Nokia</a> might be interested in buying RIM. Not many seem convinced that this would be a good move for either, though.</p>
<p>And on an ironic story twist, there first was news of a <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/12/06/1752244/playbook-jailbreak-tool-released">jailbreak tool for the PlayBook being released</a>. Later came news that about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/19/5000-blackberry-playbooks-stolen-from-a-truck-stop/">5000 PlayBook units were stolen from a truck</a>. Maybe they broke out themselves?</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/07/2015224/eff-asks-to-make-jailbreaking-legal-for-all-devices">the EFF is seeking to make jailbreaking devices legal</a>. That&#8217;s pretty much a &#8220;duh&#8221; if you work in this industry but I guess they got away with it once and now it&#8217;s just legacy to be legally allowed to prevent jailbreaking.</p>
<p>Finally, for RIM, there seems to be some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/rim-denies-blackberry-10-delay-allegations-claims-are-uninformed/">controversy over announcing a device and reasons for postponing it</a>. Not sure what to think of that.</p>
<p>Moving to shocking news from HP. <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/12/08/1545236/hp-reviving-the-99-touch-pad-on-december-11th">They sold their last batch of TouchPads two weeks ago</a>. The interest in this firesale apparently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/11/they-love-me-they-really-really-love-me">brought ebay and paypal to their knees</a>. Quite an achievement since both server parks are supposed to be able to hold quite some traffic.</p>
<p>The final decision for WebOS was also made by the way. It&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/09/hp-to-keep-webos-alive-by-making-it-open-source/">becoming open source</a>. The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/09/meg-whitman-hp-webos-memo/">internal memo</a> also surfaced. Although HP is maintaining they could still be making tablets with WebOS in 2013, I&#8217;m not convinced that the platform will stil be relevant by that time. <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/16/047226/how-hp-and-open-source-can-save-webos">There&#8217;s been</a> <a href="http://functionsource.com/post/an-open-source-webos">a lot</a> <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2011/12/webos_opensourc.html">of speculation</a> over what open sourcing will mean for WebOS. So far it means <a href="https://github.com/hpwebos/webos/wiki/">an empty repo</a> with a few <a href="https://github.com/hpwebos/webos/issues/3">pull requests</a>. Why not open source it first and then announce it?</p>
<p>HP also <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/a_new_hp_so_close_yet_so_far_away.php">has a new logo</a> by the way. An interesting move since you&#8217;d think they have bigger things on their mind right now than investing in a new brand logo (and replacing any and all things that contain the old logo&#8230;). At least <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2011/12/14/hp-has-a-new-logo-and-they-can-do-it-in-css/">they could do it completely in web technology&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Enough about HP, let&#8217;s talk about Dell. Well, we can be quite brief about Dell. They announced to <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/12/06/1617246/dell-kills-streak-7-bails-on-android-tablets">stop producing Android tablets</a>. I&#8217;m not sure if the world noticed.</p>
<p>Microsoft is up next. Warning, this section actually mostly contains positive stuff. Mostly.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/12/09/microsoft-pushes-silverlight-5-with-h-264-decoding-and-improved-3d-support/">They pushed out Silverlight 5</a> with h264 decoding support. It also has better 3d support for XNA programming. SL5 is rumored to be the last version of Silverlight&#8230;</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/">open sourced the azure SDK</a> (which runs with Node.js!). And unlike the empty WebOS repo, <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-node">Azure is actually open sourced on github</a>! Yay for them <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>In a more general move to open source, they announced that the <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/12/1841259/windows-8-store-will-allow-open-source-apps">Windows8 store will allow contain open source as well</a>. That&#8217;s a nice move.</p>
<p><a href="http://webwereld.nl/nieuws/108929/microsoft-onthult-sociaal-netwerk-voor-studenten.html">Microsoft launched a new social network</a> (<a href="http://so.cl">so.cl</a>), specifically targeting students. Not sure whether that&#8217;ll ever evolve to a platform to be reckoned with. But hey, at least they&#8217;re trying.</p>
<p>In another round of good news Microsoft also announced that <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2011/12/15/ie-to-start-automatic-upgrades-across-windows-xp-windows-vista-and-windows-7.aspx">IE will start auto-updating from Windows XP onward</a>. To be very honest, I&#8217;ve not been forced to bother myself with cross browsers so I wouldn&#8217;t even know about that shit anymore, but I can certainly see how it should make everybody&#8217;s life easier. Let&#8217;s hope this will be the final-final-yes-we-are-sure-its-dead-final nail in the coffin for IE6. Probably not.</p>
<p>Microsoft wasn&#8217;t all sunshine and butterflies though. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/21/2344202/itc-judge-motorola-mobility-infringed-microsoft-patent">They won a patent case against Motorola</a> (ahem, Android), although only one of 6 patents were actually found to be infringing. This patent covers being able to schedule stuff in the calendar through email. Found too obvious by the EU, it seems it&#8217;s not so obvious for the Americans. Ok, whatever. We&#8217;ll have to see whether Motorola will start paying for the patent, exchange patents or will simply remove the feature from the few phones that have it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a game for the Windows Phone that uses a certain engine, the &#8220;Unity3d gaming engine&#8221; that&#8217;s released by Microsoft. The pun here is that the same engine is restricted to be used by other developers or companies. Oopsie?</p>
<p>Moving on. Google seems to get more heat lately. Now there&#8217;s <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/21/1356246/senators-recommend-ftc-perform-antitrust-investigation-of-google">a senator that recommended the FTC to put Google under a tight watch</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/19/139236/bt-sues-google-over-android">Android has been sued by BT for infringing some of their patents</a>. If successfulness this could mean more expensive Android devices. Nobody wins here.</p>
<p>The only other Google related news is that after a long time, Google and Mozilla signed a new agreement where <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/20/206208/mozilla-and-google-sign-new-agreement-for-default-search">Google pays Mozilla for being the default search engine in their browser</a>. It&#8217;s rumored that this deal concerned nearly 300 million dollar.</p>
<p>In random news, the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/06/1328220/indian-minister-seeks-to-censor-user-generated-content-online">Indian minister asked big content sites to manually filter user generated content and apply censors</a> where they see it fit. How ignorant can you be?</p>
<p>In Holland there seems to be <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/245768/dutch_ssl_certificate_provider_gemnet_investigates_website_compromise.html">a second Diginotar case</a> as another certificate authority (Gemnet) was hacked. This hack seems to be less invasive, although the hack was made through a phpmyadmin interface. Ouch, how amateurish can you get? There were also some bad certificates being distributed by KPN, which puts the blame on the sudden load increase and having to train new people quickly because of this. How about &#8220;Sorry sir, you&#8217;ll have to wait&#8221;? Meh.</p>
<p>There was some news about Carrier IQ (the mobile keylogging crapware?) regarding the FBI. There was <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/12/2237200/fbi-rejects-freedom-of-information-act-request-about-carrier-iq">a &#8220;freedom of information act&#8221;-request</a> for more information about this which was denied on grounds that it might interfere with some kind of investigation. Speculation ensued. <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/12/13/2347241/carrier-iq-responds-to-fbi-drama-eff-wants-more-information">Carrier IQ tried to squash this speculation</a> but I think a statement like this is doomed to fail. And it did.</p>
<p>In the world of Ubuntu, Java might be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a thing of the past</span> <i><a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2011/12/why-java-isnt-dead-on-ubuntu/index.htm">replaced by OpenJDK</a> (thanks @cramforce)</i>. <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/java-to-be-removed-from-ubuntu-uninstalled-from-user-machines/">There will soon be an &#8220;update&#8221; to remove Sun Java from Ubuntu distros completely</a> as the license for Ubuntu has run out. <i>And replaced by OpenJDK, which is now the lead version for Java 7</i>. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Wait wut? Wasn&#8217;t Java open source, open platform, freely available, bla? What the hell is going on here.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/19/att-tmobile-merger-dead/">The mega merger of ATT and T-mobile has been canceled</a>. ATT basically pulled the plug after the American government initially reject the move. On top of that the EC also had some problems with it. Interestingly enough, this 38-billion-something dollar deal now comes down to a 2-billion-something freeby for T-mobile, due to cancellation terms in the contract. Nice catch, T-mobile. This pretty much means the end of ATTT.</p>
<p>And finally, I woke up this morning to see Twitter on fire with protesters because GoDaddy (the biggest American domain company) published a blost post <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/23/0253207/godaddy-backs-sopa">to support SOPA</a>. Oopsie. They&#8217;re catching quite some flack from this (and are losing quite a few registered domains in the process) and might inadvertently have started a raging ban of any company that supports SOPA. Nice job!</p>
<p>I find the case of GoDaddy especially interesting because it seems to me like SOPA is mainly something that concerns people on the web. GoDaddy gets most of their business from these people. So if they support something that would be bad for the web, their sole purpose of existence, would they seriously not expect flack from this? Or has the GoDaddy company (d)evolved to such a level where it&#8217;s just monkeys running the company and techies only doing the actual work. Le sigh.</p>
<p>With that, I conclude this episode and wish you happy days from the Uxebu team! <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, hello there! Last week started quiet but as the week progressed some interesting plot twists were introduced. Let&#8217;s get to them&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-2054"></span></p>
<p>It was revealed that <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/03/2112220/carrier-iq-drama-continues">many hand sets of various vendors had a keylogging &#8220;trojan&#8221; installed</a>. The makers of the software, Carrier IQ (or &#8220;CIQ&#8221;), call it a piece of software to gather usage statistics and help vendors with creating better devices while keeping these statistics anonymous. They rejected that it was in fact a keylogger, but a researcher proved it pretty decently that it was in fact a keylogger. Several vendors, including Apple and several Android vendors, worked with the software. For some reason they all seem to be reluctant to continue with it though&#8230; Funny how that works. I personally think <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/1623.html">this Santa cartoon</a> is spot on <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/3321924/htc-wins-us-ruling-over-digital-camera-patents/">HTC won a dispute from Flashpoint</a> that could&#8217;ve banned HTC smartphones in the US.</p>
<p>Microsoft had some PR moments. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/231901113">Balmer throwing up on Android</a> and some other stuff. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9222299/Google_slaps_down_Ballmer_s_assertion_about_cloud_biz">Google responded to Microsofts</a> cloud claims though, and <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Salesforcecoms-Benioff-Rips-Oracle-Microsoft-Again-532669/?kc=rss">Salesforce added</a> to this dispute that Microsoft is actually not that big a deal in the cloud. Ouch.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no week without Apple and Samsung throwing dirt at each other. This week <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/12/03/judge-vetoes-apples-attempt-to-have-samsung-galaxy-sales-halted-in-u-s/">Apple lost a preliminary injunction</a> for Samsung Galaxy sales in the US. Lost is a bit of an overstatement though, as the judge did seem to side with Apple but didn&#8217;t think the injunction would make much difference to Apple. Sounds like a burn for Samsung to me, but alright.</p>
<p>I guess a bit unsurprising was the article about <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/12/02/revealed-apples-internal-policies-on-employee-social-networking-speculating-on-rumors-leaking-blogging-and-more/">Apple&#8217;s closed culture and censorship</a> of it&#8217;s employees while on the job but also on personal notes. I mean, it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise.</p>
<p>The PR department of RIM is doing overtime. Overtime of damage control that is. They had a launch in Indonesia <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2011/12/05/rim-indonesia-head-is-summoned-as-police-investigate-launch-event-violence/">that went a little sour</a>. Promising discounts to a limited number of people but then changing the rules amidst the chaos that ensued, ending up with a police investigation into the whole thing. And talking about RIM and the police, two executives were taken away by the cops after they got so drunk and annoying that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rim-drunk-airplane-2011-12">they caused an intercontinental plane</a> to turn around to eject them from the plane. Oopsie..</p>
<p>RIM also seems to follow HP in <a href="http://connectedplanetonline.com/mobile-apps/news/PlayBook-discounts-cost-RIM-485-million-outages-50-million-1202/">dumping some Playbooks</a>&#8230; They still seem to be committed though. Then again, so was HP. </p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nodejs/status/142430171180449792">Node.js 0.6.4 was released</a>. But <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/8803e5fbe28984af?hl%3Den?hl%3Den%26pli%3D1">you might have missed that party if you&#8217;re trying to get it from China</a>. Turns out they block anything with 64 due to the content due to the Tianenman Massacre, which happened on the fourth of May (6-4). So it turns out the oh-so-great firewall of China blocks this pseudonym by arbitrarily blocking the number 64 in various variations. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ryah/status/143253922436493312">Node.js 0.6.5 was released quickly though</a>, with a minor NPM fix. Sounds more like a minor version fix to me.</p>
<p>Finally, there was some fallout from the support of SOPA by the BSA. <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/06/038246/kaspersky-quits-bsa-over-sopa-support">Kespersky resigned from the BSA</a> because of it. I&#8217;m actually not sure whether that&#8217;s good or bad news, but it&#8217;s a sign at least. A sign of &#8230; something! <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Bai!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohai!</p>
<p>To be honest, last week was very quiet. I haven&#8217;t seen a whole lot of interesting things pass by. Or maybe we&#8217;re just &#8220;spoiled&#8221; by the past few weeks&#8230; Anyhow, let&#8217;s see what happened&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-1968"></span></p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="http://www.itworld.com/mobile-wireless/225615/barnes-noble-pummels-microsoft-patents-prior-art">took a legal beating</a> from Barnes and Nobles for getting sued by Microsoft over using the Android on their Nook.</p>
<p>Microsoft also <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/11/22/nokia-the-reason-microsoft-kiboshed-dual-core-windows-phone-handsets/">seems to be the reason there are no dual core Windows phones</a> available. It didn&#8217;t think Nokia could ship dual core phones before the end of 2011, missing the holiday seasons shopping spree.</p>
<p>Oh and remember that tidbit about Yahoo refusing a few billion from Microsoft a few years back? The same Yahoo that you wouldn&#8217;t want to buy for a few thousand now? Well it sounds like <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/11/25/0222212/microsoft-just-cant-quit-yahoo">Microsoft is having second thoughts</a>. Although I&#8217;m sure the price will be considerably lower than a few years ago&#8230;</p>
<p>The other company in the news was HP. It complained to the EC (European Commission..) about Oracle not wanting to port Oracle apps to support HP hardware. It seems Oracle led them to believe this was going to happen, only to change their minds later.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no week without some weird WebOS news fact. This week it&#8217;s all about printers! Apparently <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/11/21/hp-webos-intel-qualcomm-printers/">HP wants WebOS in printers</a> and makes that an important part of any negotiations of selling some of their assets. Meh?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have for you right now <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Bai!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you ready for a packed episode of Zee Closure? I had to skip last week due to being pretty busy. Amongst other things we were present at the Full Frontal conference, organized by Remy Sharp. We actually sponsored that conf! The conf was awesome, good talks, great people and free drinks. What else do you want? <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><img src="http://p.twimg.com/Aef020iCAAAFv2P.png:medium"/></p>
<p>So on to the world of web. Oboy!<br />
<span id="more-1927"></span></p>
<p>The topics that follow may not be in chronological order. Or even in order of importance. Or even matter, for that matter <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Mozilla announced a move to <a href="http://www.bitstampede.com/2011/11/07/documentation-of-the-open-web-should-be-for-everybody/">open up their documentation site</a> (commonly referred to as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>) and not just add specific information for Firefox there. That means that soon those articles will also contain oddities and support details for other browsers. That&#8217;s a great thing and will make an awesome resource even more awesome..er? <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> I wonder whether they&#8217;ll rebrand it though&#8230;</p>
<p>Microsoft had a few tidbits. First came the news about <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/11/microsoft-gives-up-on-competit.php">giving out prizes</a> for <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-offering-free-stuff-internet-explorer-9-holiday-downloads">just downloading</a> IE9, which some people frowned upon. Then news of <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/11/07/2114234/windows-phone-unlock-tool-goes-official">an official Windows phone unlocker</a>. Maybe one of the first big corps to release an unlocker for their phone so that&#8217;s pretty damn cool. They also got into a fight with Barnes and Nobles, who <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-08/barnes-noble-urges-u-s-regulators-to-probe-microsoft-on-mobile-patents.html">asked officials to investigate abuse</a> on Microsoft&#8217;s end on the mobile patents. (They are receiving quite a bit of money from vendors that have Android based phones.) And something that should surprise nobody, except maybe the shareholders, <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/11/16/0035226/microsoft-shareholders-unhappy-after-annual-meeting">the shareholders seemed to be a bit antsy</a> at the last annual share holders meeting. They&#8217;re not happy with how the board isn&#8217;t transparent on the heading of the company, and the stock price trend of the last ten years. Gosh.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, remember that Windows 8 bootlock lockout that was announced a bit back? Yeah, <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/11/17/1928203/windows-8-secure-boot-defeated">I don&#8217;t think you have to worry too much about it</a>.</p>
<p>On to Apple! Or maybe&#8230; no, let&#8217;s do Apple first. <a href="http://applidium.com/en/news/cracking_siri/">Siri&#8217;s protocol has been cracked</a>. Alright, that was one they should&#8217;ve seen coming. Why don&#8217;t they just open up a public API for Siri and&#8230; haha, yeah right. They did <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/11/16/ios-5-0-2-could-arrive-next-week-to-fix-battery-ios-5-1-may-add-siri-functions/">release a new iOS5 firmware</a> in a second attempt to battle the battery issues, and slipstream in some new Siri functionality.</p>
<p>Bridging the gap between Apple and Samsung, Samsung actually seems to have won a bit of ground. The <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/11/09/australian-court-forces-apple-to-hand-over-private-operator-iphone-business-terms/">Australian court ordered Apple to hand over operator deals</a> to Samsung, which were private (*ahem* secret). I&#8217;m sure the lawyers will just love that. And Samsung also won a little ground (back) in Germany, where <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/11/05/motorola-confirms-that-a-german-court-has-granted-it-a-patent-injunction-against-apple/">they got an injunction for the Apple iPhone4</a>. The injunction is only preliminary and did not forbid Apple to sell their phone, just to import it. For now. But yeah, good job Samsung. By the way, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/14/samsung-backs-down-wont-block-iphone-4s-sales-in-south-korea/">Samsung promised the South Koreans</a> that they wouldn&#8217;t touch the iPhone there. Meh?</p>
<p>Talking about that German injunction against Samsung, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/11/16/samsung-releases-redesigned-galaxy-tab-10-1n-in-germany-to-avoid-apple-infringement/">they got around it by modifying their Galaxy Tab</a>. So it seems the TAB&#8230;les are turned in Germany for the moment <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Oh and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/11/09/samsung-confirms-windows-8-tablet-coming-in-second-half-of-2012/">Samsung also announced a Windows 8 tablet</a>. </p>
<p>Moving on the next big thing on the web, <a href="http://m.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/exclusive-adobe-ceases-development-on-mobile-browser-flash-refocuses-efforts-on-html5/19226">Adobe admitted defeat of the Flash mobile platform</a>. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/201111/Q411IntraQuarterUpdate.html">They are now convinced that html5 is the way to go</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/201111/110811AdobeFinancialAnalystMeeting.html">will focus their effort on it</a> from now on. No official word on the Flash desktop environment, but I guess it doesn&#8217;t take an Einstein to do the math here. Shortly after the announcement <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/will-there-be-a-silverlight-6-and-does-it-matter/11180">rumors</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/9/2548975/microsoft-may-halt-development-work-on-silverlight-after-next-release">floated</a> <a href="http://slashdot.org/story/11/11/09/1920247/microsoft-killing-silverlight">around</a> about Silverlight&#8217;s fate, although I&#8217;ve not seen anything definite on this. In an interesting twist, the <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111109/so-now-what-will-ipad-rivals-say-in-their-commercials/">PlayBook will keep Flash support</a>. For now.</p>
<p>Adobe also <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/244060/adobe_donates_flex_to_apache.html">donated their Flex environment to the Apache foundation</a>, effectively open sourcing the toolkit.</p>
<p>Google pulled a switch, <a href="http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2011/11/deprecation-of-gmail-app-for-blackberry.html">removing GMail support for the Blackberry</a> (&#8220;shoo, go use our mobile web version&#8221;), but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/gmail-app-for-ios-hits-the-app-store-again/">re-releasing their GMail app for the iPhone</a> (&#8220;yeah we know, the mobile web version isn&#8217;t good enough for you guys&#8221;, wait wut?).</p>
<p>Over at HP it seems the new Captain on deck isn&#8217;t doing that much better than it&#8217;s predecessor. First comes news that it&#8217;s <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/11/09/2113219/hp-delays-webos-decision">still indecisive on what to do with WebOS</a>. Later follows the news that the new batch of TouchPads (remember the $100 firesale?) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/hp-you-suck/">can only be aquired</a> combined with expensive HP hardware, like say an entire computer. Nice.</p>
<p>One big point on the agenda for this week was of course SOPA. Apart from being a big flood gate on twitter (I won&#8217;t bother you) there were also dozen of articles from all directions. In my oppinion a good thing by the way. The tl;dr is that SOPA is a new law that makes it really easy for the USA to remove/block websites and IP&#8217;s based on copyright infringement claims. Even for websites and IP&#8217;s that are actually owned and/or operated outside of the US (the US is still the center hub for most things internet, although one may wonder how long that&#8217;s gonna last with stunts like this one). So the US congress had a hearing where they heard six parties, one against SOPA and five in favor of it. Wait, how&#8217;s that fair? Right, that&#8217;s what the rest of the web thought. Only Google was allowed to speak to defend the web. Some key points: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/11/at-web-censorship-hearing-congress-guns-for-pro-pirate-google.ars">Article about the hearing</a>. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/11/18/0224256/new-media-giants-take-out-print-ad-against-sopa">Big expensive news paper ads are telling</a>. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/11/17/2142214/eu-speaks-out-against-us-censorship">Even the European commission spoke out against it</a> (which should be a huge red flag for the US congress, shouldn&#8217;t it?). Tumblr did their duty, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/11/17/to-combat-sopa-tumblr-generates-87834-phone-calls-to-u-s-representatives/">helping with a few thousand calls to representatives</a>. And the last one is <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/11/17/which-tech-companies-back-sopa-microsoft-apple-and-27-others/">the BSA speaking favorly about SOPA</a>, which means that all companies in the BSA agree unless they explicitly disagree. Niiiice, not. What I hate most about this is that the decision is made by people who have almost zilch technical knowledge. Neither on the implementations they are voting on or what it will mean for the web. Furthermore they are ruling over things that should not be under their control. At this point I&#8217;m not sure whether it matters whether key internet infrastructures are located in the US or in China. Let&#8217;s hope SOPA and related retarded laws don&#8217;t make it. But I&#8217;m afraid that at some point, one will slip through.</p>
<p>On to slightly smaller matters&#8230; </p>
<p>Joyent released <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-joyent-deliver-first-stable-build-of-nodejs-on-windows/11178">a stable Node.js version for Windows</a>. Huzah!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts">next draft</a> of the next version of the ECMAScript 6 (the next JavaScript) version was released. Have fun <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>There was <a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/vendor-prefixes/">a small storm in the CSS world about vendor prefixes</a>. The eye of the storm lasted like two days, but I guess the discussion about vendor prefixes will only stop once they are depricated.</p>
<p>In the JS world the debate seemed to focus a bit about the AMD module spec, kicked <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jashkenas/status/136200499643949056">off by Jeremy</a> (of CoffeeScript fame) and later <a href="http://tagneto.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-not-amd.html">hashed out in more detail in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I could go over the <a href="http://js.gd">JSGoodies</a>, but I think this article is long enough as is. You can just check for yourself <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello there! Let&#8217;s see what this week brought us.</p>
<p>It turns out that HTC is currently <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/10/31/2253201/htc-becomes-highest-shipping-smartphone-vendor-in-the-us">shipping the most smartphones</a>. As <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-apple-smartphone-market-share-2011-10">this chart</a> shows you, this has nothing to do with Apple itself, but rather with Nokia dropping down a few notches.</p>
<p>An interesting move was <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/10/31/1352259/ubuntu-heads-to-smartphones-and-tablets">Ubuntu announcing to go mobile</a>. Will this finally be the open platform everybody has been waiting for?</p>
<p><span id="more-1903"></span></p>
<p>GitHub announced <a href="https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise">an enterprise plan</a>. This is normally not something I&#8217;d mention here, but since we tie in pretty close with GitHub these days I think it&#8217;s nice to know that you can now have their services in a local environment.</p>
<p>Mid-week Google surprised everybody with <a href="http://www.howtogomo.com/en/">a new mobile initiative</a> to make websites (also) accessible to mobile devices. However, the kicker was that the website that promoted it was very heavy (3mb+) and not very mobile friendly in terms of best coding practices (file size, file count, http count, etc). I&#8217;m still puzzled on why Google released it like this in the first place&#8230; and I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/news/google-s-mobile-friendly-initiative-111526">not the only one</a>.</p>
<p>Google also released their Gmail app for the iPhone, but yanked it pretty quickly after <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/02/google-why-dont-you-hang-on-to-that-gmail-app-for-a-while/">some complaints</a> as it turned out to be missing a few key features and UX. Ohwell, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be back soon <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>And while on the subject of Gmail, that team certainly hasn&#8217;t been idle. They are releasing <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/newlook_sizes.html">new UI&#8217;s</a> for the Gmail web interface. Although I&#8217;ve heard very mixed responses to that through Twitter.</p>
<p>Over at HP they bring the news of an <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/11/02/0541235/hp-announces-arm-based-server-line">ARM based server line</a>. In a more surprising newsflash, they also <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/242898/20111103/hp-slate-2-meg-whitman-ceo-leo.htm">announced a comeback in the tablet market</a> with the HP Slate 2. This comes of course after they ditched the TouchPad and seem to be trying to get rid of WebOS. It&#8217;s surely interesting to see how that pans out but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>In what can only be called an epic episode of the html5 soap, earlier this week <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13240#c47">a decision was made</a> to remove the &lt;time&gt; element from the spec, and replace it with &lt;data&gt; <i>(I didn&#8217;t get this at first but the rationale was that time is just a value, much like weight or distance)</i> This spurred a bit of a revolt <a href="http://www.adactio.com/journal/4982/">here</a> and <a href="http://html5doctor.com/time-and-data-element">there</a>. But by the end of the week the chairs revealed that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Nov/0011.html">this decision will be overturned</a>. And even though the nature of that message feels more like using formality to back out of a dark alley, I don&#8217;t think the opposing team will care much about the why.</p>
<p>In the rumor section it seems Nokia is also breeding on <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/11/02/2058241/nokia-hints-at-windows-8-tablets">a tablet of their own</a>, running Win8. At the same time manufacturers <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/11/02/2311212/no-windows-8-plot-to-lock-out-linux">are trying to sush</a> the situation of Windows 8 locking out other operating systems. Personally I&#8217;m afraid that it&#8217;s just bullshit and in the end you&#8217;ll still get locked out. But we&#8217;ll have to wait for that I guess.</p>
<p>Apple has had some mixed achievements this week as well. On the one hand they are going to <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/11/03/1532203/apple-to-require-sandboxing-for-mac-app-store-apps">require apps for the Mac app store to be more secure</a>. On the other hand they <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/11/04/0118229/spanish-firm-wins-tablet-case-against-apple">lost a lawsuit in Spain</a> to a small tablet manufacturer for abusing their &#8220;power&#8221;. But at least they got the <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/11/04/european-commission-investigates-samsung-for-patent-abuse-against-apple/">European Commission to investigate Samsung</a> for abusing patents when dealing with Apple. Win some, lose some.</p>
<p>Things in the js world seem to be mostly about gaming and classes. There was a <a href="http://www.zachstronaut.com/projects/pants2/game.html">Halloween game</a>, <a href="http://floriaen.fr/thefall/ld48/game.html">a falling game</a>, the <a href="http://fieldrunnershtml5.appspot.com/#hd">Fieldrunners game</a> and the <a href="http://www.currantcat.com/convergence/">Convergence game</a>. To finish it there&#8217;s an article to <a href="http://atnan.com/blog/2011/11/03/enabling-and-using-webgl-on-ios/">enable WebGL on the iPhone</a> (using private api&#8217;s&#8230;), turns out that was possible in 4.2 as well.</p>
<p>About classes, there&#8217;s a key turning point about to come for JS where the notion of classes are actually introduced. And while talk about syntax and semantics have been mostly on a bikeshedding level lately, this week Jeremy <i>(from CoffeeScript fame)</i> re-opened the discussion with <a href="https://gist.github.com/1329619">his own proposal</a>. And after Zef from Cloud9 posted <a href="http://cloud9ide.posterous.com/the-time-has-come-to-add-classes-to-javascrip">his/their view</a>, I kind of felt obliged to finally post <a href="htt://qfox.nl/weblog/243">my own views</a> on what I would like the class syntax to look like.</p>
<p>That was it for this week. See you next week!</p>

<p>Last week didn&#8217;t really have a central theme. There were a few interesting developments though.<br />
<span id="more-1895"></span><br />
The VP of WebOS at HP <a href="http://www.precentral.net/richard-kerris-leaving-hp-an-opportunity-outside">is leaving</a> HP. WebOS just can&#8217;t catch a break huh.</p>
<p>Over at IBM they figured the dust has settled around replacing CEO&#8217;s so this would be a good time to announce <a href="http://slashdot.org/story/11/10/25/2242206/virginia-rometty-selected-as-next-ceo-of-ibm">their own replacement</a>. And wait&#8230; no mud? Whoa.</p>
<p>Nokia released their <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/10/26/1426228/nokia-unveils-its-first-windows-7-phone">first win7 phone</a>. And from what I gathered, it seems to have been received well. I&#8217;ve yet to see one myself though <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>An interesting tidbit was Mozilla releasing <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/10/26/2058248/official-firefox-with-bing-released">a special Firefox build with Bing</a> as the default search engine provider. Mozilla currently gets most of their money from the Google as default search engine deal. Maybe they don&#8217;t want to depend on a single source of income?</p>
<p>As a followup on an earlier reported story, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/26/sony-will-buy-out-ericssons-stake-in-handset-venture-for-1-47-billion/">Sony will now actually buy out Ericsson&#8217;s stake</a> in their partnership. So I guess the &#8220;Sony Ericsson&#8221; brand will slowly fade away.</p>
<p>And on the far end of the week <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/mobile-news/every-android-device-now-infringes-apple-patent-slide-to-unlock/5199">Apple received a patent for slide-to-unlock</a>. This is of course interesting because every mobile device uses a slide to unlock mechanism (although I personally prefer Androids grid pattern unlocking, but whatever). Let&#8217;s see how that one plays out in the all-out patent war.</p>
<p>Oh and have a look at this <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/10/html-parsing-wi.html">html parser in js</a>. I found that pretty nifty <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>See you next week! No wait, this week. Oh noes confusion!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, this week has been very qui-et. There&#8217;s actually very little to report, especially considering the past two weeks.<br />
<span id="more-1890"></span><br />
RIM unveiled their new plans for <a href="http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/11/10/18/2155219/rim-unveils-new-os-based-on-qnx">an OS based on QNX</a> called BBX. Unfortunately they&#8217;re already <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/20/rim-already-having-legal-woes-over-bbx-trademark/">facing court</a> due to that name. I guess TLA&#8217;s are pretty much out these days&#8230;</p>
<p>Other than that there&#8217;s been some more fighting between Samsung and Apple, with Samsung pretty much drawing the short stick on all accounts. But let&#8217;s not go into that anymore.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s actually pretty much it. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll pick up next week <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> Apple will announce their Ken to Siri or maybe Microsoft will buy Yahoo after all.
