				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post by David Pfahler and Stephan Bönnemann of <a title="keeplook.in" href="http://keeplook.in">keeplook.in</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Total reading time: 3:57min (based on <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Improve-your-product_-Make-better-tutorials.mp3">Alex</a>)</strong></p>
<p>When you try to learn a new programming language or work with a new framework for the first time you&#8217;re likely to google something along the lines of &#8220;How to &#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;framework X tutorial&#8221;. As a developer you might also be the one writing how-to articles for your own creations. If you&#8217;re interested in turning your 569-page long, textbook-style manual in to a golden asset of yours, please read on.</p>
<p><span id="more-2238"></span></p>
<p>Your 20th century, worn out screencast series isn&#8217;t that fancy either&#8230;</p>
<p>Some users just get started with programming or using a framework (or whatever your product might be). Not everybody is a pro. For the rest of us tutorials are a low-barrier entry to your creation.<br />
Furthermore, thinking about tutorials early on will force you to avoid complexity. For example, if you can&#8217;t explain a concept in simple terms, you should probably think about it again. By putting yourself in the shoes of your prospective customer you help yourself to create a better product in the end.</p>
<h2>So how should an amazing tutorial look?</h2>
<p>The idea behind most tutorials is to show the reader a step by step protocol of how you, the developer, would do it. However, what the user really wants is to learn, not to watch the presenter using his evil vim skills to confuse the overwhelmed newbie who is busy trying to get off the ground. One would learn way faster if she was live coding and seeing the results as she writes the code herself.<br />
I&#8217;d love to see more editors in the browser used for this purpose. For example, the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> uses an in browser editor and console to teach programming to beginners.</p>
<p><a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/codecademy.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2255" title="Codecademy" src="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/codecademy-300x190.png" alt="Codecademy Screenshot" width="300" height="190" /></a></p>
<h2>How to use multi media the right way</h2>
<p>Screencasts are a popular tool when it comes to tutorials. However, they are not interactive, so the user can only watch but not try for herself unless she pauses the video and switches to a text editor, checks the results and repeats. Also, you can&#8217;t copy and paste from a screencast. We can do better.<br />
Video can transport emotions. So I think it should be used for just that. How about a short introduction to the topic one is about to tackle? Just ten seconds of someone talking to you &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; make the whole experience more personal. Audio can do a great job at communicating a lot of content without requiring a lot of screen estate. Carrying on with the last example, the person who gives the introduction should also be the speaker of the tutorial. Additionally, text can help with copy &amp; paste issues, hyperlinking to other resources such as the documentation, etc.</p>
<h2>Positive feedback loops vs. frustration</h2>
<p>Most tutorials that I encountered where quite frustrating. The reason being that there was no positive feedback loop supporting my will to learn more. For example, I never knew how long it will take to complete a certain tutorial. This sometimes leads to me not even starting because it gives me a psychological excuse.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I probably won&#8217;t be able to complete it before lunch, anyways.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ah nice! This is going to be done before lunch.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So, in your tutorials please tell the user how much time she has to invest. As this forces you to think about the structure and length of your lessons, your whole tutorial will benefit.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">khan academy</a> does a great job at keeping its students motivated with occasional achievement badges. People want to be rewarded when they take the effort to learn something new. Tutorials are a tool for just that. So please treat it like learning. Progress can be rewarded constantly for example with points or a virtual currency that one earns. I think we can learn a lot from games in regard to how they keep people engaged.</p>
<p><a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/khan.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2256" title="Khan Academy" src="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/khan-300x99.png" alt="Khan Academy Screenshot" width="300" height="99" /></a></p>
<p>If you have some good examples, please let me know in the comments.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the end the user is the reason for your creation, product or project. Thinking about your tutorials early on is a good way to ensure you&#8217;re producing something of value. Because your users are the ones who will ask you questions about your project, will buy your products (if they are for sale), submit pull-requests and talk about your creation in public, a great set of tutorials will benefit you the most.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><br />
Don&#8217;t spend your budget on a social media campaign run by an evil marketing firm. Spend it on your tutorials. It&#8217;s the best marketing there is.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><strong>codecademy</strong></a>: Nice editor in the browser. Positive feedback loop.<br />
<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org"><strong>khan academy</strong></a>: Eleborate achievement system. Also, nice for improving your general knowledge.<br />
<a href="http://learn.knockoutjs.com"><strong>knockoutJS</strong></a>: Editor in the browser, progress saved in localStorage and it can fix your code.<br />
<a href="http://tryhaskell.org/"><strong>Try Haskell</strong></a>: Interactive console for learning/trying Haskell.<br />
<a href="http://layerstyles.org/"><strong>Layer Styles</strong></a>: Play around with the parameters and get an intuitive feeling for the css behind it. That&#8217;s the power of live editing.</p>

<h2>Why you’d like to use HTML5 audio in iOS 5</h2>
<p>It’s all about apps these days. The question is whether you want to make the commitment and investment (of learning a new language) to program natively for one platform or leverage the web dev skills you already have? HTML5 is the way to go if you sympathize with the latter.<br />
<span id="more-1977"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: The main problem for web developers that want to make apps is to deliver a great <strong>user experience</strong>. Hence, you&#8217;d like to use as much of today&#8217;s web technologies as possible to enhance the UX. One profound way of doing this is audio feedback. For example, many twitter apps use sounds if new tweets come in and another sound if no new tweets could be found. This kind of response is intuitive to the user. This is what you should go for.</p>
<p>Also, imagine a game without sounds. Would be kind of boring, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<h2>Naive Assumptions: What you’d expect</h2>
<p>Fortunately in iOS we have rich HTML5 support built into mobile Safari. Initially, Steve Jobs wanted all apps to be web apps! So what you&#8217;d assume regarding audio is the presence of the HTML5 audio tag. And guess what, there <em>is</em> an implementation of the audio tag in iOS. Hurray!</p>
<p>So what do you expect from an audio tag implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>call .load(), .play(), .pause() and other methods via JavaScript</li>
<li>use remote files, dataURIs, cached files and other sources</li>
<li>play several audio files / tags at once</li>
<li>mix audio from several sources with different volumes, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reality checks: What should work but doesn’t</h2>
<p>It becomes clear pretty fast that it&#8217;s not that simple. With iOS it&#8217;s a disaster. The bad news first:</p>
<p><strong>It is not possible to load or play audio without user interaction.</strong></p>
<p>Sad, but true. <a title="Safari Developer Library" href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/ControllingMediaWithJavaScript/ControllingMediaWithJavaScript.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH3-SW5">Apple deliberately decided</a> that a touch event is mandatory to load and play audio. There is no workaround for this.</p>
<p>If we accept the fact that we need a touch event to play the audio, is it possible to use the audio tag as expected? Hmm, no, not really. So what&#8217;s broken as well?</p>
<p><strong>Latency</strong>: Loading audio files on demand (after the touch event fired) is unusably slow. The desired user experience can not be achieved using this technique.</p>
<p><strong>One audio tag at a time:</strong> You can never play more than one audio tag at once. This makes it impossible to mix sounds on the fly which would be necessary for games that have a background music and must also play sounds dynamically (e.g. when the character jumps).</p>
<p><strong>Audio files only:</strong> You can not use anything as the source besides audio files (uncompressed WAV and AIF audio, MP3 audio, and AAC-LC or HE-AAC audio). If you could use dataURIs then it would be possible to preload the audio.</p>

<h2>Workarounds: How to play anyways (at least somehow)</h2>
<p>We invested a lot of time researching the audio tag on iOS 5. If you want to know how we play audio, read on.</p>
<p>So what do you do with this crippled audio tag? Well, you trick it a little bit and use it as much as possible. Here are several ideas that work best for different scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Bind touchstart event to body:</strong> As you have to play on a touch event, we bind a touchstart handler on the body. So wherever the user touches first, we can use this event to load the audio file. Even better, from now on, we can load and play different sources from this audio tag.</p>
<div class="codecolorer-container text default" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;"><div class="text codecolorer" style="padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap">bodyEl.addEventListener(&quot;touchstart&quot;, function() {<br />
audioNode.load(); audioNode.play();<br />
}, false);</div></div>
<p><strong>Hot swapping sources:</strong> We can now change the &#8220;activated&#8221; audio tag&#8217;s source on the fly. So it is now possible &#8211; without user interaction (!) &#8211; to load and play different sources. But you can only play one source at a time, of course.</p>
<div class="codecolorer-container text default" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;"><div class="text codecolorer" style="padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap">audioNode.addEventListener(&quot;ended&quot;, function() {<br />
audioNode.src = &quot;newSource.mp3&quot;;<br />

<p><strong>Use audio sprites:</strong> The guys over at Zynga use audio sprites in their <a title="Zynga Jukebox on github" href="https://github.com/zynga/jukebox">Jukebox</a>. This means that you have a huge audio file containing one sound that you want to play, then one second of silence, then another sound and so on.</p>
<p>Example for a sound sprite structure:<br />
1 second silence<br />
First sound<br />
1 second silence<br />
Second sound<br />
1 second silence<br />
Third sound</p>
<p>In this file you include all the audio that you possibly want to play in your app. You only load the source once (as described above) and then jump to the relevant parts in the file. So the file is always playing but most of the time it just plays silence. When you need the sound, you can quickly jump to the part in the file that you need to play. This solution is quick (much faster than hot swapping!) but requires a long preloading phase before you can play the most sounds, because the file is bigger.</p>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>So audio in iOS is pretty much broken. If you are using a native wrapper like PhoneGap you could use native APIs via plugins like <a href="https://github.com/purplecabbage/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/SoundPlug" title="SoundPlug on github">SoundPlug</a>. We&#8217;ll try what is possible in the upcoming versions of iOS. Please let us know your ideas and feedback in the comments.</p>
<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>Regarding Philip&#8217;s comment, this is how we think it could be.</p>
