		<description><![CDATA[Hi David, 
 
I already use touchScroll and it&#039;s brilliant. Any thoughts about extending it to work with Windows8/IE10?

		<description><![CDATA[I could use the same functionality as Israel. I&#039;ve got the touchscroll applied to divs in my navigation, but the script is interfering with my video elements, which are outside the nav. I read in the other touchscroll thread that the video problem has no real solution. So, being able to selectively trigger the touchscroll would be of great help. 
 
And as I don&#039;t work much with javascript, it isn&#039;t a simple thing for me to make a callback function, like Damian has done. I could really use some sample code to work from... ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Israel 
I had the same problem and solved it by adding some code to the framework. I added a construction argument that lets you specify a callback function that would be called prior to do any scrolling stuff. This callback function is in charge of letting the TouchScroll objet do its magic by returning true. Is not to hard to make this change, just take a look to the code. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, 
 
I was intending to use your library for a project. However, I just hit a wall and I was wondering if you, or anybody can help me. 
 
I have a webpage W:768px x H:1024px and I want to have the scroller on a div that&#039;s W:470px x H:100%. It works, however the touchscroll.min.js file takes over the touches on the entire page. I need the rest of the site area to be able to receive touches so I can do more cool stuff. Is there anyway to restrict touchscroll touches to the div being affected? 
 
Thank you in advance.

		<description><![CDATA[The first alpha of 0.2 works somewhat on Android 2.2 (HTC Droid Incredible).  In portrait mode it is mostly fluid scrolling but hangs every now and again when trying to modify the config fields.  If I turn my phone to landscape, the page never resizes itself with the header/footer but I can still scroll what is visible. ]]></description>
