		<description><![CDATA[Hello there, - spotted this web page due to pure luck whilst searching around the net this evening, and pleased that I did! I like the layout and colours, but I should mention that I&#039;m having problems when it loads. I&#039;m making use of Lynxlet 7.1 internet browser for mac, and the top panel won&#039;t align well. i am sure  applied precisely the same layout on a company&#039;s internet site, but the menu seems fine on mine. I suspect the error is at my end &amp; maybe today&#039;s the day to change for a better one! ]]></description>
