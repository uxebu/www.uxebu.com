		<description><![CDATA[[...] I really enjoyed the conference. Even more than the talks it was the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people. It was awesome to meet so many German contributors and committers of other JavaScript frameworks. On Thursday evening there was a nice Oktoberfest organized with Leberkäse (meatloaf), Brathendl (grilled chicken) and Maßbierkrüge (1l glasses of beer). We sat together with the dojo guys from uxebu (Wolfram Kriesing, Nikolai Onken and Tobias von Klipstein), Jan Kassens (Mootools), Paul Bakaus (jQuery UI) and Jörg Kress. We had a lot of tech talk, some beer and really a nice evening. Check out the video of our &quot;framework round table&quot; in Tobias&#039; blog post. [...] ]]></description>
