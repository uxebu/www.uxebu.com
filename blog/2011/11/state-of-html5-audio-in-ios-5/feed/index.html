		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing development for a product that will run strictly on Wifi enabled iPad&#039;s... no phone data or cell-towers will be involved in any way.

The autoplay function within HTML5 is crucial, as this is a translation application that involves multiple devices.

I think Apple should simply allow for audio/video autoplay when you are on wifi. Problem solved!

I literally am going to go and get a Droid tablet today due to this issue... this project also includes purchasing hundreds of these devices in the next 2 months, so Apple lost good revenue over this issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This issue is equally unfortunate for video, you must click the video to play and then it will open up full screen. This is a deal breaker for projects such as Popcorn.js that are attempting to add interactive programmability to html5 video.  
 
Anyway, great post, thanks for bringing more attention to this issue. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve written two articles about the iOS video/audio tags and their quirks.

http://weblogs.vpro.nl/digitaal/2011/10/24/advanced-html5-video-and-audio-use-on-ios-bugs-and-quirks/

I&#039;ve mostly come to the same conclusions. Another problem is that even *with* user interaction you can&#039;t do asynchronous callbacks, so you&#039;ll have problems doing Ajax calls for extra metadata for your audio.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I experienced pretty much the same as you.
But I solved it the &quot;most acceptable&quot; way that you can have a low-delay playback on iOS. The concept uses background sounds in your sprite file ... and automatic stream correction running within a sound loop.

You could take a look at it, solves cross-device problems pretty well, runs on any Desktop, Android and iOS device supporting audio. (except IE9, because it&#039;s buggy and crashes with memcopy :D)

		<description><![CDATA[With my 250MB monthly data cap, I&#039;m quite happy that playing audio and video requires user interaction as this gives me a chance to decide whether the audio/video content is important enough for me to warrant the download (hint: it probably isn&#039;t).

Arguably Apple could change this behavior depending on whether you are on WiFi or Mobile, but I guess that wouldn&#039;t be very trivial to implement and could also be confusing to users as it wouldn&#039;t be consistent UI.]]></description>
