		<description><![CDATA[@Scott, I am pretty sure that the order is from left to right, what you can try is &quot;function1() &amp;&amp; function2()&quot; and if function1 returns false function2 never gets executed. That&#039;s also what the (famous) trick &quot;func1 &amp;&amp; func1()&quot; is for, so that you check for existence first. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, thanks Jason for writing that down, that was what I implicitly tried to say with the comparison to 2, thanks for writing it down in real words :) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just so it&#039;s clear, the confusion here comes about due to the coercion of Boolean values to 0 or 1 (via toNumber), specifically.  That is, 
 
x == true  
 
gets coerced to  
 
x === 1 
 
Honestly, I don&#039;t really understand why the rules don&#039;t allow for comparing Boolean to other &quot;truthy&quot; numbers, but that&#039;s just the way it is. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Been bitten by this several times previously when trying to do comparisons inside if statements. Took 3 of us an hour to figure it out, then it seemed so obvious. Blows your mind to see this in the console: &#039;3 &lt; 1 &lt; 3&#039; returns &#039;true&#039;.

Another place where this sort of pattern gets me is JavaScript var statements. Doing &#039;var x= y = 2&#039; gives you one local, one global.

Doesn&#039;t the order of operations become (x == (2 == y))?]]></description>
