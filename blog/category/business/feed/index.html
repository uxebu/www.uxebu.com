<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“<em>We have a really good idea about developing a new web product.</em>”</strong></p>
<p>Usually, this is what we actually think, but in the sentence there is a huge mistake: “a really good idea”. No. It’s not necessarily a good idea! I read countless forums, articles, stories about failure in startups. Too many! But the most of them have a similar basic structure: a brilliant idea, a great product, a cutting-edge technology, an experienced team. And yet they fail. How is it possible?</p>
<p>I assume for sure that those startups actually have a forefront technology and a skilled team. The hardest part is connecting the “brilliant idea” with the “great product” in a logical way.<br />
Normally in startups we get excited quite quickly: “new product? Yess! Let’s do it! Let’s invest all our money, time and effort…we believe it will be a success!”<br />
…<strong>WRONG</strong>!<br />
Due to their trust in a technology’s, product’s or service’s superiority, many startups fail to spend enough time exploring alternative business models.<br />
The aim is to find the best and more scalable technology and product, therefore also startup’s ideas should have a referring business model! Seems to be something theoretical and difficult, boring and useless.<br />
Normally it could be but, believe me, for startups it’s not! (PS: actually, we’re not a startup anymore, but still our small and dynamic business well relates to many startup business models :))</p>
<p>An innovative idea usually leads to a product, very far from being a “great” product. This could probably end with being new, innovative, and potentially a success. The key word here is “potentially”. How to be sure that we can get rid of that adverb?</p>
<p>Well, we’ll obviously never be sure, but we can still try to do things in a more conscious way <strong>JUST ASKING</strong>! It’s so simple…<br />
Ask your consumers what they think about that new product: would they use it? Would they pay for it? What’s wrong with it? Could it be improved? Etc… But be careful: questions have to be well structured! Never ask “would you use it?”. That’s an hypothetical question, it makes no statistic sense. (I’ll explain better how to create a good questionnaire in the next blog post :))<br />
Seems simple, but it’s not. Very often startups don’t even know who exactly their users are. Identifying the customer should be the “step 1”, before everything else. And, we know, sometimes it’s not simple at all. How is it possible not to know at least which is your consumer?<br />
Well, take Uxebu as an example: in our company, we (actually, they) are great web development consultants. We were thinking about launching a new product/service on the market, a very technical product, intended for expert programmers. Basically, a niche product. At the beginning, the “expert programmers” were our target clients. But it is perhaps too generic? Of course it is! Which exactely are our customers? What jobs are they really trying to get done? Are there enough potential customers to let our business grow? Do they have buying power? How can we reach them?<br />
Defining all this is the first step to define the specific market in which you are going to operate. The most obvious advice is: <strong>sit down and brainstorm</strong>. Who could take advantage of our products? Computer Science students? Yes. Of every country in the world? Yes. And Professors? Yes. CTOs? Of course. And so forth, until you have a complete list of ALL of those that could be potential clients. The more specific the better!</p>
<p>…And now what?</p>
<p>And now start with your business model! Before even thinking of preparing a questionnaire for our customers, we structured our own <strong>Validation Board</strong>, one of the core tools for startups who want to innovate. It’s quick, simple and effective, and it also opens up your mind, helping to think constructively. Interested? In the next blog post we’ll explain you how we are using it: in our case it is turning out to be absolutely crucial!

<p>Here we are, our event recently ended, and I’m here to draw some conclusions.<br />
I have to say, we are extremely pleased with the result! It took a considerable time to organise everything, but it was totally worth it! We obviously had sponsors: thanks to <a href="http://www.mayflower.de/de" target="_blank">Mayflower</a> for the food, to <a href="http://www.elance.com" target="_blank">Elance</a> for the drinks and to <a href="http://www.werk1muenchen.de" target="_blank">WERK1</a> for the location. I’ll discuss the event in more detail in a second blog post (including a list of the tools you suggested too!), here I only want to….ehm, well, basically I only want to thank all the participants: it’s thanks to them that the event was so gorgeous!<br />
<span id="more-3111"></span></p>
<h3>What was it about?</h3>
<p>A JS CodeRetreat is a a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design.<br />
Basically, this event gives the opportunity to practice TDD, Clean Code and Refactoring for a whole day. The main difference between the CodeRetreat and our JS CodeRetreat is that normally you can use different programming languages, instead we decided to use only JavaScript, therefore this was a more focused CodeRetreat.</p>
<p>More than 80 attendees used <a href="http://www.tddbin.com"><strong>TDDbin</strong></a> (basically all of the people without a JavaScript testing environment). This is an Uxebu product, released only the night before the event&#8230; we had lots of positive feedback for TDDbin too!! So happy <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
This time Madrid and Valencia joined too (we were 100 people totally!), and for the next time we already have requests from other countries!!! This is so awesome <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Considering the fact that we’ve had many positive feedback, we decided that, from now on, <strong>this is going to be a regular event, probably taking place every 3 months</strong> or so (the next one is already fixed for the 10th OF MAY!).</p>
<p><strong><em>Ok, I’ll stop being boring and lengthy…</em></strong> want to see some pics? Want to get an idea of the amount of tweets regarding us and you all? Here you are!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first days as an intern at uxebu were hilarious… yes, hilarious for everyone but me: I didn’t get half of their laughs and furrowed eyebrows. Sometimes they were just looking at me astonished and baffled. Now, in retrospect, I can understand why.</p>
<p>I am a stranger in a foreign country, and, although Italy isn’t so far away from here, we are two very different people: we are in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics)">PIGS</a>, they are Germany. According to the modern economic literature, we are the boorish, they are the cool and efficient ones.</p>
<p>When I first arrived at uxebu, I really wanted to give a good impression: I wanted them to see that I’m a smart and polite person, no way related to the messy-Berlusconi-bunga bunga Italians (note: I didn’t say I didn’t wanted to be related to a pig; considering the industrial amount of food that I steadily devour, that would be impossible).<br />
<span id="more-3012"></span></p>
<h2>Trust me</h2>
<p>At the beginning, relatively to the fact of being polite, I asked for permission every time before going to the bathroom, before having a coffee, before everything… and that is where I started to see the first furrowed eyebrows: “sure you can!”; “why are you asking?” …… “STOP ASKING! You can do whatever you want”.</p>
<p><a href="http://v2.uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/poker-face.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3018" src="http://v2.uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/poker-face-300x266.png" alt="poker-face" width="300" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, whatever. <strong>In this startup environment, basically everything works trusting each other</strong>. I wasn’t used to all this. Trust has to be gained, it’s not a right! Instead here things work the opposite way round: they trust in you as long as you deserve it. Trust concerns to most of the working relationships, everyday and in every situation.</p>
<p>And with regard to altruism? I remember when my boyfriend came to Munich to visit me. In order to see him asap, I really wanted to ask my colleagues if I could leave work half an hour before the usual time. But at the end I didn’t. I thought that the justification of my boyfriend visiting me wasn’t a good enough reason to leave earlier.<br />
When they found out that he was coming, they told me out of their own volition “you should go home earlier today!”.<br />
I could keep going on telling you more and more, but as you saw I don’t have the gift of synthesis, so better if I stop here with the examples.</p>
<p>I guess for some of you this working mindset and behaviors are completely normal, but I’m pretty sure that others are thinking “wow, lucky girl!”. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>“The psychology of work”&#8230;</h2>
<p>While I was thinking about all this, I was reminded of an exam, the course’s name was “The psychology of work”&#8230; I know what you’re thinking … “that’s bullshit”. Basically you’re right, that was the typical exam after which you had the highest score ensured, therefore it was very popular. However, some of the contents were very interesting. Everything revolved around the fact of trusting the employees, being this a way to make them feel valued and respected, and by acting in this way probably the productivity at work would have increased.</p>
<p>What already bothered me at that time was that such a simple and obvious concept was instead so difficult to apply to the real life.</p>
<p>I constantly talk with people totally dissatisfied with their workplace, and the most of the reasons relate to the behavior of their bosses towards them: strong hierarchies, useless formalisms, overly strict rules of obedience to the chiefs. I mean, respect and obedience are totally fine, and in larger companies hierarchies are almost a must (trouble if not!). What I really don’t fully understand are excesses. Why? Where is the advantage of forcing people to dress in an overly formal manner? Why people aren’t allowed to have the freedom to act and think in the way that best suits them? Why don’t they realize that unhappy people work worse? (And, let&#8217;s face it, sooner or later dissatisfied people are going to speak badly of their working place, which certainly does not help the company’s image).</p>
<p>Perhaps startups exceed on the opposite side. But, know what? It’s completely granted to them. They are usually young, self-made, cool, working with friends in a co-working space. They can decide how to shape their one business as they prefer.</p>
<p>Startups are a world apart, unique and incomparable. But I still think that each of us has a lot to learn from them, both in the private life and in the businesses.<br />
<strong>Trust</strong> should be the foundation on which to build our lives.<br />
Obvious? Yes, Nevertheless….</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re making good progress in the organization of our event: according to our <a href="http://www.jscoderetreat.com">official website</a> and to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/207534969438337/?fref=ts">Facebook event</a> we should already have 35 participants. Right now, our main issue is related to the gadgets: which ones should we choose? And, most importantly, how many?<br />
<span id="more-2982"></span></p>
<p>It’s not it easy to guess how many attendees there will actually be, and for us this means a notable lack in our planning. If we order too much stuff (gadgets, food, drinks) we’ll probably waste money, and I do not even want to think about the case of ordering too few. We’ll still have to figure out with some supermarkets if it’s possible just to give back the items that are still packaged… hope for the best!</p>
<p>Btw, we thought of pretty nice gadgets for the participants. First of all, we wanted something that could be useful and frequently used, but still well looking. We expect our attendees to look at them with the “wow!” expression, thinking “I want that!!”.<br />
I will not reveal you what we’ve eventually chosen, but I’ll give you just a tiny clue: one of them is edible <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> for the rest, surprise!</p>
<p>We have prepared a number of price lists, differentiated according to the number of gadget to order, the prices, their different characteristics etc., in order to have several combinations of the total final prices, which, when the time comes, will facilitate our ultimate decision.</p>
<p>There is an additional small problem that bothers us: the design. We have a couple of (hopefully good) ideas, but we still need help. Luckily there is a talented designer who is able to give us a hand with this issue (thank you Viktoria! <a href="http://antfarmdesigns.com">antfarmdesigns.com</a>).</p>
<p>There are several additional minor issues that we are trying to solve day by day, and luckily everything is going well (at least for now!).</p>
<p>I hope that this event will continue to give us many satisfactions <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before being an intern at uxebu, I was not familiar with the startup environment. For me startups were just new and small businesses with innovative ideas. Nothing too exciting.</p>
<p>I began to realize that I had to deal with something new and unknown since the first Skype interview: it was scheduled at 3 p.m., and from 2 p.m. I started looking at my closet in a very concentrated way, searching for my best clothes and the most well-chosen accessories. I mean, I was applying for my first job in a foreign country and I’m Italian, so “probably they expect me to be a fashion addict”… I just didn’t want to disappoint these hypothetical (and senseless) expectations.<br />
<span id="more-2848"></span></p>
<p>At the end I was simply perfect: lovely blu dress, earrings fully in line with the necklace, makeup designed for this occasion (I’m a mess at make-up, therefore I had carefully studied a youtube tutorial before the interview).</p>
<p>When the interview started, in front of me there were two guys in white t-shirts.</p>
<p>One of them, which seemed to be just a little older than me, was the CEO.</p>
<p>WHAAAAAT???</p>
<p>My first day of work (15th of November, I’ll never forget it) was enlightening: in WERK1, our co-working space, the usual “Friday breakfast” was taking place (though not usual at all to me). All the people working there stopped doing whatever they were doing and came to join all the others in the main hall: bread, jam, nutella (!!!), biscuits, coffee… and, according to the Fridays (pleasant later discovery), also pretzels, cheese, beers (I love Bavaria!). This place had gained my total respect.</p>
<p>What really surprised me? That all the people there were:</p>
<p>• dressed up in a very informal way;<br />
• all friends;<br />
• mostly working in the programming/coding field;<br />
• switching from German to English language just according to my presence;<br />
• helping each other with suggestions regarding whatever matter;<br />
• very interested in who I was;<br />
• basically all males;<br />
• not eating nutella (come on guys, are you serious?).</p>
<p>But working at a startup is much more than this.</p>
<p>What’s really different from the normal companies (yes, to my eyes they are not ordinary at all… and, I have to say, their abnormality is awesome) is the mindset. The keyword for startups is “<strong>sharing</strong>”: whenever they discover something new, they share it. Whenever they create something new, they share it. Whenever they don’t know something, they look to what others shared.<br />
They always work with an <strong>open source mentality</strong>.</p>
<p>This was something totally new to me. In my University environment, if you had something that others didn’t have, better for you. If you had notes that others didn’t have, worse for them. If the others wanted something that you had, it was a good and right thing to get paid for sharing it.<br />
This really was a huge business: the most sophisticated students used paypal.</p>
<p>Today is exactly two months that I am in Munich (happy month anniversary to me!), and I feel that I’m changing, changing for the better. Anything new I’m discovering I’m now like “oh great! I want to share this…”, which is a totally different attitude from what I was used to. I learned a lot staying here, especially with regard to the computers and the sharing websites.<br />
This is a great mindset: internet means open source above all, why not contribute to this great modern revolution?</p>
<p>But, I have to say, there is also the other side of the coin. Whenever I share something on the main socials, where all my friends are too, they just don’t care. If I ask them to help me answering to some questions, they are largely uninterested. I perfectly understand them, I mean, until a short time ago I would have done the same. But I think it is a great pity.<br />
I feel that people just don’t understand what an enrichment sharing is, and how helping others, albeit only in a virtual way, could increase a lot the consideration that people have of them (and, let&#8217;s face it, if I help you today, tomorrow you will help me… we can both take advantage of this, without spending a penny!).</p>
<p>I really hope that this modern and rewarding mindset will catch on: it’s not yet a widespread practice, and I wish that people will understand the importance of all this as time goes by.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love to organize events! I organized pretty big parties before coming here, and I loved to plan graduation parties for my friends (in the North-East of Italy graduation parties are held in a very folkloric way, not common at all… I&#8217;ve never seen anything like those parties and behaviors in the rest of the world. Pure insanity).</p>
<p>But this JS CodeRetreat is something completely different. Here we are dealing with German computer geeks and programmers, who expect to learn, enjoy and eat all day long.<br />
Help.<br />
We’ll make it? Of course we&#8217;ll make it! (At least until Murphy decides to lay down the law).<br />
<span id="more-2906"></span></p>
<p><strong>MORNING:</strong><br />
After having explained me with amazing patience how the JS CodeRetreat was supposed to work, Wolfram and me went to a brief meeting in <a href="http://www.mayflower.de" target="_blank">Mayflower</a>, another company partner of the event, where there was <a title="Martin Ruprecht" href="https://twitter.com/mrupilo">Martin Ruprecht</a> waiting for us (actually, to be honest they were both waiting for me only, as I got lost on the way there&#8230;thanks Google Maps to go crazy every time I need you).<br />
There were many things to decide: from the choice of the Kata to use and the detailed planning of the sessions, to other issues regarding the amount of food for our guests or the number of chairs we needed.<br />
All this might seem trivial, but it’s not at all. Our main goal for the 8th of February is to see dozens of satisfied faces, and to achieve this it’s very important to focus on the details that can make a difference.</p>
<p>In addition, I remind you that <strong>the event is free for everyone</strong>, except for us and for the sponsors: we will organize everything and pay whatever it takes, while attendees will only have to enjoy a day out of the ordinary, learning and having fun at the same time. There are lot of expectations from all parties involved, and the aim is not to disappoint any of them.</p>
<p>During our 4 hours meeting, we took several decisions: we’re going to use “the game of life” as the kata, and we’ll split the event into 5 sessions. Each session will be using the same kata, but with different restrictions.<br />
After a while, we have planned the whole event’s timetable (you can see it <a href="http://jscoderetreat.com/schedule.html" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>We also made some decisions regarding food and beverage, step that seems to be much more challenging than expected… basically, the problem is that we always get really excited when it comes to talk about food, so every single thing that comes into our mind seems to be the greatest idea ever: from pizza to wraps, from bretzel with butter to indian food… we’ll see what the future is going to bring.</p>
<p>An additional difficult decision concerned the “global retrospective” moment: during the event (that, as said, is going to take palce in different places at the same time), we’ll connect with the other cities, with the goal of having a real time overview of the partecipant’s opinions through all locations. But: how to connect? Which technology shall we use? How can we get in touch at lunch time if in Spain people eat much later than in Germany? (As you can see, food is always an important topic).</p>
<p>It ended with me suggesting to use huge colored blank billboards and rainbows markers, relating sessions to colors or something….I don’t even remember. I only know that when I start talking about rainbows and other crazy stuff I’m usually hungry.</p>
<p>The last topic of the morning regarded promotion: social networks, specific websites for promoting events, and other websites mainly in German language, concerning Germany and Munich in particular.</p>
<p><strong>AFTERNOON:</strong><br />
During the afternoon we basically created our mind map, of which we are quite proud. I really think that it could be useful to whoever wants to organize an event, so I’ll write the next post explaining how our mind map actually works. Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are planning a JS CodeRetreat for February 8th (ah, btw, if interested, here’s the link to the website: <a href="http://www.jscoderetreat.com">jscoderetreat.com</a>), and I, of course, wanted to lend a hand in the organization. The question was: how could I help if I didn’t understand at all what it was about?</p>
<p>For this reason, some days ago my boss (-sorry Wolfram for calling you “boss”…- in the startup environment people just don’t like hierarchies and strict working structures) decided to devote a couple of days just explaining me what’s the event about.<br />
One of the most interesting things is that the JS CodeRetreat is going to take place in different cities at the same time: Munich, Dublin, Valencia and Madrid are for sure, but there is still place for anyone else to join!<br />
<span id="more-2856"></span></p>
<h3>What’s a CodeRetreat?</h3>
<p>A CodeRetreat is an event that always takes place in a similar way (thanks Corey Haines!). As written in the official CodeRetreat website (<a href="http://www.coderetreat.org">www.coderetreat.org</a>), a Code Retreat is “a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice away from the pressures of &#8216;getting things done&#8217;, the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement”.</p>
<p>Basically, this event gives the opportunity to practice TDD, Clean Code and Refactoring for a whole day.<br />
The main difference between the CodeRetreat and our JS CodeRetreat is that normally you can use different programming languages, instead we decided to use only JavaScript, therefore this will be a more focused CodeRetreat.</p>
<p><strong>WHY ONLY JS?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we wanted to give all the participants the opportunity to concentrate even more on the craftsmanship and even more on one language, in order to dive even deeper and find out more about how to become better.</p>
<p>We decided to split our event in 5 sessions, in which attendees will work on the same problem over and over again, but using different constraints in every session.<br />
In each session people will pair with a different programmer to maximize the knowledge transfer. The most interesting thing is that after each session all the code that has been written so far is deleted. This gives to all the participants the chance in the next session to all start over again without being constrained by any design decisions they made in the previous one.<br />
The combination of pair programming with the focus on writing perfect code instead of solving the problem gives a unique opportunity to improve the attendees skills.</p>
<p>SOUNDS INTERESTING, RIGHT? <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Before speaking to my boss, I had never heard of such an event. I was (actually, I am!) very interested in all this coding world, but I have no clue on how it all works… so how could I help?</p>
<p>Well, organizing an event requires a lot of time and effort, both aspects that don’t require a specific knowledge of computer programming (thank goodness).<br />
The hardest thing to face is that we still have our regular work to do, therefore, to better organize the event, we have to organize our time first.</p>
<p>In the following pages, I’ll keep you updated with our progress in organizing the JS CodeRetreat, hoping that our experience could be of help to some of you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I’m Irene, the marketing intern at uxebu.</p>
<p>Keyword: <strong>marketing</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because uxebu is a very well known German startup which basically operates in the high quality IT consulting field. And I’m the marketing intern.<br />
Doesn’t sound strange until now, right?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you all something more about my experience. I graduated in Marketing and Business Administration in Trieste, Italy. I’m a girl, so normally people don’t expect me to be able to optimally use the computer and all the related stuff. Usually male humans look at me amazed when I show them how to safely remove the usb stick. BUT I felt different! I have always been interested in computers, and I (<strong>incorrectly</strong>) thought I was quite good in using them.<br />
<span id="more-2842"></span><br />
Friends of mine considered me a sort of computer geek just because I knew how to code in HTML or I knew some particular features in MS Office. A very good friend once also said me “wow, you know how to use a wireless printer. YOU SHOULD WORK IN THE COMPUTER FIELD!”.</p>
<p>Result? I got caught up in excitement. I felt like a computer boss for years and years. I mean, I studied business stuff, so whatever falls outside that context seemed to me to be non required knowledge, therefore something that goes beyond the people’s expectations. In short, I felt like a computer whiz, without any apparent merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then I arrived at uxebu.</strong></p>
<p>People speaking in German (I really don’t understand a word of German language), about topics I’ve only distantly heard of during random listening to my boyfriend or watching The Big Bang Theory (that has nothing to do with coding, but for me an absurd speech is worth the other): JavaScript, Python, Ruby on Rails, Coding Dojo, API, TDD….aaaaaaaah!!! At the end also the word “browser” confused and scared me. You know when you hear terms and words that are impossible to remember, so your brain just shuts down for a while? Well, before coming to Munich, normally this happened when I was listening to THOSE words (or to German language…).</p>
<p>Now I’m here, with German speakers doing whatever stuff using weird words.</p>
<p>During the first weeks I said to myself “OK Irene, you don’t have to deal with all of this. You are the marketing intern, we defined that as THE keyword. Don’t bother with all the rest”. But, know what? <strong>It’s impossible to do marketing without the global knowledge of what your company is exactly doing</strong>: “XX sent this email, what does it mean? What should I reply?”; “On social networks they are asking us for some information, what’s exactly the question and what should I answer?”; “Ok, I’ll update your blog, sure&#8230; Ehm…..Can I talk about the weather or what?”.</p>
<p>Without having the general (but still specific!) knowledge of the working environment in which your company operates, you can’t work in the proper way. You’ll always waste the people’s time, asking trivial questions which however require a detailed answer. It’s a waste of time, time is money, and you, as a marketing intern, should be helping making money, not throwing it away!</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to squeeze my brain and force myself to do everything possible to better understand all of this computer matter. I have to say, I’m quite proud of what I have been able to learn! Thanks to great teachers too <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Uxebu is spreading its knowledge, get some of it &#8211; for 699€ if you are an early bird (999€ later)!</h2>
<p><span id="more-1554"></span></p>
<p>Uxebu is now operating it&#8217;s business purely in the JavaScript space for about three years (oh that reminds me we should have a party!). We are convinced that JavaScript is ramping up now and we see that there are more and more things done and possible with the language. The browser landscape is developing rapidly and changing every day. The mobile industry is pushing the limits and we are helping to do our part in it. We learned a lot and are still learning. As it is in the nature of our company to spread our knowledge to allow everyone to use the technology at it&#8217;s best and push the limits with us, we think now it&#8217;s the time that we share our knowledge and pass it on to those hungering for diving into JavaScript!</p>
<p>We really have <a href="http://twitter.com/void_0">gathered</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jensarps">a lot</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/tobeytailor">bright</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/evilhackerdude">bleeding-edge</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/kuvos">people</a> and each of us is learning from another everyday. If you want to get some of the know how (at least as much as we can pass on in a two day workshop) you are invited to <a href="http://uxebu.com/html5-workshop/">join our workshops</a>. There will be one held in <a href="http://de.amiando.com/jsmunich.html"><strong>Munich 29th and 30th of June</strong></a> and another one in <a href="http://de.amiando.com/jsamsterdam.html"><strong>Amsterdam 11th and 12th of July</strong></a>. We will always have at least two uxebus teaching you the latest and hottest. We might even have some of the latest <a href="http://twitter.com/twtomcat/statuses/79157866954637313">bleeding-edge mobile devices</a> for you to run the app you will develop in the workshop.</p>
<hr style="margin: 4em 0;" />
<h2>Workshop Details</h2>
<p>In this course we will cover a broad spectrum from JavaScript essentials to the bleeding edge of cross platform HTML5 development. We start from the ground up and go step by step, depending on the level of the participants we accelerate to show you the deep and dark sides of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Each day of the course is split into an intensive “knowledge transfer” session in the morning and a hands on hacking workshop in the afternoon in which you will apply the contents learned during the morning. At the end you will have touched all contents not only through theory but also through intensive real life application and coding.</p>
<p><em>Note that this course will not explain you how to work with jQuery and also not how to work without jQuery. The course mainly focuses on JavaScript, mobile and HTML5.</em></p>
<h2>Day 1 (part 1) &#8211; JavaScript</h2>
<p>We start with a small overview of the history. We tackle the basic structure of the language and move on with <strong>statements</strong>, <strong>expressions</strong>, <strong>functions</strong> and <strong>objects</strong>. We touch the different <strong>operators</strong> and when semi colons are introduced.</p>
<p>We continue our way through the JavaScript landscape by taking a look at <strong>objects</strong>, <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>built-in functionality</strong>. At that point we’ll encounter our first major obstacles; <strong>scopes</strong> and <strong>closures</strong>. Once we conquer these we touch on the <strong>difference between functions and constructors</strong>. This is followed by our second major obstacle; <strong>prototype</strong> and the various values of the <strong>this keyword</strong>.</p>
<h2>Day 1 (part 2) &#8211; Hackday: HTML5, CSS3</h2>
<p>During the second part of day one, we will take what we have learned in the morning and mix it with a little shot of HTML5 fanciness. We will look at all those new APIs we can now access on our (mobile) devices to bring JavaScript to a new level. We will include cool APIs such as the <strong>Audio API, Video API, history, Canvas, SVG, File API, WebGL, DeviceMotion, WebWorkers, WebSocket, GPS</strong> &#8211; and if all ingredients fit well you might just end up with your first app written in JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Day 2 (part 1) &#8211; The App Day</h2>
<p>During the second day we willl continue with <strong>timers</strong>, <strong>callbacks</strong>, <strong>web workers</strong>, <strong>eval</strong> and the <strong>future of JavaScript</strong>. The speed of the course is matched with it’s participants. The important parts of the languages will be handled in the workshop. During the first part of day two we will also specifically look into topics which you want to cover after determining those during day one. This will give you the chance to get all your open questions answered so that you have your pockets full of knowledge after the workshop is over.</p>
<h2>Day 2 &#8211; part two (Mobile)</h2>
<p>JavaScript has grown strongly into the mobile space, so we will show you how to get the app you have started building during day one onto <strong>mobile devices</strong>. You will learn about <strong>media queries</strong>, some <strong>device sensors</strong>, <strong>performance</strong> and HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript tricks and how to optimize some parts for mobile and how to make a <strong>native app</strong> out of it, so you finally could even make get it into the <strong>app store</strong> and make money with it.</p>
<h2>Now you want to join our workshop?</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the MWC in Barcelona I moved my working place to Valencia for a week, a little further south. That is already a while ago, but still I wanted to write a little bit about all the experiences. Not last because I very much want to thank all the people who I have met, who introduced me into the spanish community and made all this so much fun. Thank you very much first and foremost <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/coworkvalencia">Rosa</a> &#8211; you rock! Thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/XaV1uzz">Xavi</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/txau">Jaume</a>, Jorge, Luis, and &#8230; fuck I am so bad with names :(.<br />
<span id="more-1519"></span></p>
<h2>Coworking in Valencia</h2>
<p>My week in Valencia started out to look very quiet and just pure work. I tried to contact some JavaScript/mobile/web guys in this area before hand, but somehow didn&#8217;t really succeed. Some tweets went around but I didn&#8217;t really reach anybody. But I made sure I have a great place to work at, which was <a href="http://coworkingvalencia.com/">Coworking Valencia</a>, Rosa Montesa runs this place with so much passion &#8211; wow. And I just had to think of the <a href="http://www.combinat56.de">Combinat56 Coworking</a> space in Munich where we normally go, which is run by Sina with an equal lot of passion. Just great girls!</p>
<p>So I arrived there Monday morning to do my work, and off it went. I chatted a while with Rosa and some other coworkers and from there I couldn&#8217;t stop it. At the end of the day my calendar was filled with lunches and meetups. I met a lot of interesting people, first Rosa had organized a small come-together the next day with the company <a href="http://www.brainstorm.es">Brainstorm</a> from right above, mainly hackers too, so we had quite some stuff in common. There I met Jorge who introduced me to more geeky people, thank you so much!</p>
<h2>Spanish way of life</h2>
<p>So the week went on and I tried to work a little bit, but I was basically so happy to live the spanish way of life a little bit. In the morning you don&#8217;t buy a take away coffee, actually you don&#8217;t see the busy people running around with their coffee mugs in there hands. I also just did that the first day, after that I adopted the spanish way, which is sitting down in a bar (also if it just for five minutes) and have a coffee. A lot of people there have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carajillo">carajillo</a> in the morning but that was not appropriate for my mornings :).<br />
For lunch (later than normal for me, around after 2pm) we mostly went to some place outside, since it was at least 20°C, beautiful sun just perfect. And then on the way home you just take some tapas maybe a beer in the bar around the corner and late at night (normally after 9pm) we had dinner. For me working there felt really comfortable and easy going. But I have also heard that normally working in Spain is not normally that relaxed.</p>
<h2>The real geeks</h2>
<p>On Thursday I went to the <a href="http://www.becodemyfriend.com/">BeCode</a> guys&#8217; office in the nice <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Carmen_(Valencia)">Barrio del Carmen</a>. The first thing after I arrived was &#8220;let&#8217;s go for a coffee&#8221; :). That is the spanish style! We exchanged the ideas of how we work and the kind of projects we do. Xavi the daddy of BeCode (scnr) told me that they are an incubator and try to have people come in and realize their ideas, pretty cool stuff. Was so refreshing and forward-thinking, I felt home.<br />
Funny enough that day I learned about <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> there, they used in a project. Unfortunately we had no internet that day, so I was pretty much offline until the afternoon, which was somehow good, but not when you really want to get some things done. So I promised to be back the next day and then the office was also really crowded and I got to meet all of the <a href="http://www.becodemyfriend.com/equipo/">BeCode team</a>. In the evening I joined my first <a href="http://blog.dev.openfinance.es/2011/03/ii-coding-dojo/">coding dojo</a>, this one was held in the offices of <a href="http://blog.dev.openfinance.es/">OpenFinance</a>. We were given the task to write a roman to latin numbers converter in whatever programming language you like. You are given half an hour and try to get as far as you can, I joined forces with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/txau">Jaume</a> we got it easily done in the half an hour time, we simply used the <a href="https://github.com/vf/web-testsuite">webtestsuite</a> as our testing framework since I know that one best and of course we wrote the converter in JavaScript :). As a second Kata you could hack the conversion the other way around. Jaume and I felt that this would be just another hacking it the other way job was, so we looked for a new challenge and we said let&#8217;s just use the google search engine for converting it for us and we just grab the result from there. We looked at a couple of APIs, at YQL but there was no real solution, so we went the scraping route. We got it almost done :). But as you <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57436095@N03/sets/72157626167343224/with/5485645335/">can see</a> <a href="http://blog.dev.openfinance.es/2011/03/ii-coding-dojo/">and read</a> we had lots of fun and enough beer!<br />
Of course we went for dinner later and were still hanging out some time around Valencia and in the BeCode office later. There the guys told me about an Code Retreat which is going to take place somewhere near Valencia &#8220;en el campo&#8221; with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paella">Paella</a> cooking and hacking, I hope that some of us uxebus may join, hope to find out details soon.</p>
<p>All in all a big thank you to all you guys and I can just say I had a great, though also really exhausting, two weeks in Spain. Hope to see you soon!</p>
