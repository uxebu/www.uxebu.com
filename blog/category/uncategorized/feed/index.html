				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first days as an intern at uxebu were hilarious… yes, hilarious for everyone but me: I didn’t get half of their laughs and furrowed eyebrows. Sometimes they were just looking at me astonished and baffled. Now, in retrospect, I can understand why.</p>
<p>I am a stranger in a foreign country, and, although Italy isn’t so far away from here, we are two very different people: we are in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics)">PIGS</a>, they are Germany. According to the modern economic literature, we are the boorish, they are the cool and efficient ones.</p>
<p>When I first arrived at uxebu, I really wanted to give a good impression: I wanted them to see that I’m a smart and polite person, no way related to the messy-Berlusconi-bunga bunga Italians (note: I didn’t say I didn’t wanted to be related to a pig; considering the industrial amount of food that I steadily devour, that would be impossible).<br />
<span id="more-3012"></span></p>
<h2>Trust me</h2>
<p>At the beginning, relatively to the fact of being polite, I asked for permission every time before going to the bathroom, before having a coffee, before everything… and that is where I started to see the first furrowed eyebrows: “sure you can!”; “why are you asking?” …… “STOP ASKING! You can do whatever you want”.</p>
<p><a href="http://v2.uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/poker-face.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3018" src="http://v2.uxebu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/poker-face-300x266.png" alt="poker-face" width="300" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, whatever. <strong>In this startup environment, basically everything works trusting each other</strong>. I wasn’t used to all this. Trust has to be gained, it’s not a right! Instead here things work the opposite way round: they trust in you as long as you deserve it. Trust concerns to most of the working relationships, everyday and in every situation.</p>
<p>And with regard to altruism? I remember when my boyfriend came to Munich to visit me. In order to see him asap, I really wanted to ask my colleagues if I could leave work half an hour before the usual time. But at the end I didn’t. I thought that the justification of my boyfriend visiting me wasn’t a good enough reason to leave earlier.<br />
When they found out that he was coming, they told me out of their own volition “you should go home earlier today!”.<br />
I could keep going on telling you more and more, but as you saw I don’t have the gift of synthesis, so better if I stop here with the examples.</p>
<p>I guess for some of you this working mindset and behaviors are completely normal, but I’m pretty sure that others are thinking “wow, lucky girl!”. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>“The psychology of work”&#8230;</h2>
<p>While I was thinking about all this, I was reminded of an exam, the course’s name was “The psychology of work”&#8230; I know what you’re thinking … “that’s bullshit”. Basically you’re right, that was the typical exam after which you had the highest score ensured, therefore it was very popular. However, some of the contents were very interesting. Everything revolved around the fact of trusting the employees, being this a way to make them feel valued and respected, and by acting in this way probably the productivity at work would have increased.</p>
<p>What already bothered me at that time was that such a simple and obvious concept was instead so difficult to apply to the real life.</p>
<p>I constantly talk with people totally dissatisfied with their workplace, and the most of the reasons relate to the behavior of their bosses towards them: strong hierarchies, useless formalisms, overly strict rules of obedience to the chiefs. I mean, respect and obedience are totally fine, and in larger companies hierarchies are almost a must (trouble if not!). What I really don’t fully understand are excesses. Why? Where is the advantage of forcing people to dress in an overly formal manner? Why people aren’t allowed to have the freedom to act and think in the way that best suits them? Why don’t they realize that unhappy people work worse? (And, let&#8217;s face it, sooner or later dissatisfied people are going to speak badly of their working place, which certainly does not help the company’s image).</p>
<p>Perhaps startups exceed on the opposite side. But, know what? It’s completely granted to them. They are usually young, self-made, cool, working with friends in a co-working space. They can decide how to shape their one business as they prefer.</p>
<p>Startups are a world apart, unique and incomparable. But I still think that each of us has a lot to learn from them, both in the private life and in the businesses.<br />
<strong>Trust</strong> should be the foundation on which to build our lives.<br />
Obvious? Yes, Nevertheless….</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re making good progress in the organization of our event: according to our <a href="http://www.jscoderetreat.com">official website</a> and to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/207534969438337/?fref=ts">Facebook event</a> we should already have 35 participants. Right now, our main issue is related to the gadgets: which ones should we choose? And, most importantly, how many?<br />
<span id="more-2982"></span></p>
<p>It’s not it easy to guess how many attendees there will actually be, and for us this means a notable lack in our planning. If we order too much stuff (gadgets, food, drinks) we’ll probably waste money, and I do not even want to think about the case of ordering too few. We’ll still have to figure out with some supermarkets if it’s possible just to give back the items that are still packaged… hope for the best!</p>
<p>Btw, we thought of pretty nice gadgets for the participants. First of all, we wanted something that could be useful and frequently used, but still well looking. We expect our attendees to look at them with the “wow!” expression, thinking “I want that!!”.<br />
I will not reveal you what we’ve eventually chosen, but I’ll give you just a tiny clue: one of them is edible <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> for the rest, surprise!</p>
<p>We have prepared a number of price lists, differentiated according to the number of gadget to order, the prices, their different characteristics etc., in order to have several combinations of the total final prices, which, when the time comes, will facilitate our ultimate decision.</p>
<p>There is an additional small problem that bothers us: the design. We have a couple of (hopefully good) ideas, but we still need help. Luckily there is a talented designer who is able to give us a hand with this issue (thank you Viktoria! <a href="http://antfarmdesigns.com">antfarmdesigns.com</a>).</p>
<p>There are several additional minor issues that we are trying to solve day by day, and luckily everything is going well (at least for now!).</p>
<p>I hope that this event will continue to give us many satisfactions <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before being an intern at uxebu, I was not familiar with the startup environment. For me startups were just new and small businesses with innovative ideas. Nothing too exciting.</p>
<p>I began to realize that I had to deal with something new and unknown since the first Skype interview: it was scheduled at 3 p.m., and from 2 p.m. I started looking at my closet in a very concentrated way, searching for my best clothes and the most well-chosen accessories. I mean, I was applying for my first job in a foreign country and I’m Italian, so “probably they expect me to be a fashion addict”… I just didn’t want to disappoint these hypothetical (and senseless) expectations.<br />
<span id="more-2848"></span></p>
<p>At the end I was simply perfect: lovely blu dress, earrings fully in line with the necklace, makeup designed for this occasion (I’m a mess at make-up, therefore I had carefully studied a youtube tutorial before the interview).</p>
<p>When the interview started, in front of me there were two guys in white t-shirts.</p>
<p>One of them, which seemed to be just a little older than me, was the CEO.</p>
<p>WHAAAAAT???</p>
<p>My first day of work (15th of November, I’ll never forget it) was enlightening: in WERK1, our co-working space, the usual “Friday breakfast” was taking place (though not usual at all to me). All the people working there stopped doing whatever they were doing and came to join all the others in the main hall: bread, jam, nutella (!!!), biscuits, coffee… and, according to the Fridays (pleasant later discovery), also pretzels, cheese, beers (I love Bavaria!). This place had gained my total respect.</p>
<p>What really surprised me? That all the people there were:</p>
<p>• dressed up in a very informal way;<br />
• all friends;<br />
• mostly working in the programming/coding field;<br />
• switching from German to English language just according to my presence;<br />
• helping each other with suggestions regarding whatever matter;<br />
• very interested in who I was;<br />
• basically all males;<br />
• not eating nutella (come on guys, are you serious?).</p>
<p>But working at a startup is much more than this.</p>
<p>What’s really different from the normal companies (yes, to my eyes they are not ordinary at all… and, I have to say, their abnormality is awesome) is the mindset. The keyword for startups is “<strong>sharing</strong>”: whenever they discover something new, they share it. Whenever they create something new, they share it. Whenever they don’t know something, they look to what others shared.<br />
They always work with an <strong>open source mentality</strong>.</p>
<p>This was something totally new to me. In my University environment, if you had something that others didn’t have, better for you. If you had notes that others didn’t have, worse for them. If the others wanted something that you had, it was a good and right thing to get paid for sharing it.<br />
This really was a huge business: the most sophisticated students used paypal.</p>
<p>Today is exactly two months that I am in Munich (happy month anniversary to me!), and I feel that I’m changing, changing for the better. Anything new I’m discovering I’m now like “oh great! I want to share this…”, which is a totally different attitude from what I was used to. I learned a lot staying here, especially with regard to the computers and the sharing websites.<br />
This is a great mindset: internet means open source above all, why not contribute to this great modern revolution?</p>
<p>But, I have to say, there is also the other side of the coin. Whenever I share something on the main socials, where all my friends are too, they just don’t care. If I ask them to help me answering to some questions, they are largely uninterested. I perfectly understand them, I mean, until a short time ago I would have done the same. But I think it is a great pity.<br />
I feel that people just don’t understand what an enrichment sharing is, and how helping others, albeit only in a virtual way, could increase a lot the consideration that people have of them (and, let&#8217;s face it, if I help you today, tomorrow you will help me… we can both take advantage of this, without spending a penny!).</p>
<p>I really hope that this modern and rewarding mindset will catch on: it’s not yet a widespread practice, and I wish that people will understand the importance of all this as time goes by.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are planning a JS CodeRetreat for February 8th (ah, btw, if interested, here’s the link to the website: <a href="http://www.jscoderetreat.com">jscoderetreat.com</a>), and I, of course, wanted to lend a hand in the organization. The question was: how could I help if I didn’t understand at all what it was about?</p>
<p>For this reason, some days ago my boss (-sorry Wolfram for calling you “boss”…- in the startup environment people just don’t like hierarchies and strict working structures) decided to devote a couple of days just explaining me what’s the event about.<br />
One of the most interesting things is that the JS CodeRetreat is going to take place in different cities at the same time: Munich, Dublin, Valencia and Madrid are for sure, but there is still place for anyone else to join!<br />
<span id="more-2856"></span></p>
<h3>What’s a CodeRetreat?</h3>
<p>A CodeRetreat is an event that always takes place in a similar way (thanks Corey Haines!). As written in the official CodeRetreat website (<a href="http://www.coderetreat.org">www.coderetreat.org</a>), a Code Retreat is “a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice away from the pressures of &#8216;getting things done&#8217;, the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement”.</p>
<p>Basically, this event gives the opportunity to practice TDD, Clean Code and Refactoring for a whole day.<br />
The main difference between the CodeRetreat and our JS CodeRetreat is that normally you can use different programming languages, instead we decided to use only JavaScript, therefore this will be a more focused CodeRetreat.</p>
<p><strong>WHY ONLY JS?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we wanted to give all the participants the opportunity to concentrate even more on the craftsmanship and even more on one language, in order to dive even deeper and find out more about how to become better.</p>
<p>We decided to split our event in 5 sessions, in which attendees will work on the same problem over and over again, but using different constraints in every session.<br />
In each session people will pair with a different programmer to maximize the knowledge transfer. The most interesting thing is that after each session all the code that has been written so far is deleted. This gives to all the participants the chance in the next session to all start over again without being constrained by any design decisions they made in the previous one.<br />
The combination of pair programming with the focus on writing perfect code instead of solving the problem gives a unique opportunity to improve the attendees skills.</p>
<p>SOUNDS INTERESTING, RIGHT? <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Before speaking to my boss, I had never heard of such an event. I was (actually, I am!) very interested in all this coding world, but I have no clue on how it all works… so how could I help?</p>
<p>Well, organizing an event requires a lot of time and effort, both aspects that don’t require a specific knowledge of computer programming (thank goodness).<br />
The hardest thing to face is that we still have our regular work to do, therefore, to better organize the event, we have to organize our time first.</p>
<p>In the following pages, I’ll keep you updated with our progress in organizing the JS CodeRetreat, hoping that our experience could be of help to some of you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While we wait for some resources to clear before releasing our demo game, King of War, let me give you a sneak preview by releasing the physics engine that&#8217;s at the core of it.</p>
<p>The physics of the game basically require a plane (2d area) with circles that can collide. I&#8217;ve considered using <a href="http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/">box2d</a> or related libraries, but as usual decided to do it myself. In hindsight, I&#8217;m not sure whether that decision was the best. It might be, because I&#8217;m sure box2d would have given me implementation headaches as well. Regardless, I did the engine myself. Which meant diving into some hardcore math. Let me take you through it <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basics. We will have only moving circles and we&#8217;ll need to properly handle collisions. First we want to be able to detect a collision between two circles. You can do that by checking the distance between the two circles and comparing that to the sum of their radii. If the distance between their center is smaller than the sum of their radii, it must mean that they are overlapping somehow. The formula for the distance between two points is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras theorem</a> and goes like this (where A and B are your points and C is your distance):</p>
<div class="codecolorer-container text default" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;"><div class="text codecolorer" style="padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap">A^2+B^2=C^2</div></div>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/xxzY4/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2va" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>We could check for this after every frame and then try to correct for it, but why would we want to do that when we can detect collisions before they happen and act accordingly? Let&#8217;s try that route.</p>
<p>First we take a look at collision detection between two circles where one circle is idle and the other is moving on a straight path, this resembles our basic most case.</p>
<p>We have two circles, A and B. A has a speed and a course (in radians, not that it really matters). The speed is the number of pixels that A moves for each step (one game frame). Each step A moves on the line A-AA (or A-A&#8217;, but I think primes are a bit harder to detect and write in code so I&#8217;ll use AA for the end point). We want to know whether A collided with B anywhere while moving on the line A-AA.</p>
<p>To compute this we create a new circle, C. C has a radius of A.radius+B.radius and the same center as B. We can now say that A collides with B while moving on the line A-AA if and only if A-AA intersects with C anywhere (within this step, of course). Turns out there&#8217;s a pretty simple algorithm to detect this exact thing.</p>
<p>All we have to do now is to check t1 and t2. If either of them is 0&lt;=t&lt;=1, then the collision will happen this step. t1 and t2 indicate where on the line the collision occurs and where exactly, relative to the line drawn. In our case that means it starts at A and ends at AA. If the number is negative, A might collide with B if it could go exactly backwards. If either t is bigger than 1 than A might collide with B in the future, but not this step.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/3CjyK/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2vb" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>Now that we have the computation when B is idle, let&#8217;s take a look how to do it when B is also moving. Since that&#8217;s how it will be a lot of the times in the game. And I tried getting away with it but that won&#8217;t work. The problem is too obvious. So how do we do the trick above on two moving bodies instead of one?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought a bit about this but couldn&#8217;t hack it. I could only come up with extremely complex computations and formula&#8217;s. None of them were worth the trouble of even trying to implement them. The horror&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131424/pool_hall_lessons_fast_accurate_.php?page=2">found a nice little trick online</a> that worked brilliantly; You simply deduct one vector from the other and apply the above algorithm on the result. Wow! Ok, so we&#8217;ve got that to work. Now what?</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/a8grV/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2vc" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>When we know where exactly a collision occurs, we must move the stone to that position. If you do this, the stones will be touching exactly. You must then determine what they do next. What happens to the speed and course when two stones collide? After giving that some thought, I&#8217;ve concluded (and observed) that it&#8217;s actually fine and easy to simply let one stone (the slower stone) move in the original course of the faster stone (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_gas">this also helped</a>). The faster stone will start moving in a course that makes a line that&#8217;s tangent to the exact point of collision. Whether it moves left or right on that line depends on the original angle of approach. This actually works out quite well.</p>
<p>In the demo below both circles have a speed (they&#8217;ll follow their blue line at the same fixed speed). The orange line is the delta vector and we can see that a collision will occur if that orange line crosses the outer (grey) circle, just like the example above.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/RNPNK/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="http://js.gd/2ve" target="_blank">Play with it on orbit</a></em></p>
<p>To determine the new speed of the two stones I cheated a little and add a fraction of the original speed of the faster stone to the slower stone and return the remainder to the other stone. This division also depends on the angle of approach, meaning that a stone that barely touches another stone will keep most of its velocity and only changes course slightly. A perfectly head-on collision causes the faster stone to transfer all its velocity to the other stone and become idle. The other stone will continue its path in the original course of the first stone at the same speed of the first stone. You could also play with decreasing the velocity to account for the collision itself, but I didn&#8217;t and it still looked fine to me.</p>
<p>Oh and there&#8217;s more, much more. If we take a look at an imminent high-speed collision where one of the stones will almost immediately hit another stone after the collision, we&#8217;ll see that we must take chaining collisions into account. This means that in the same step, one stone can hit multiple other stones. The thing we must prevent is that we don&#8217;t warp the stone by limitlessly moving an attacking stone adjacent to its target (as described above). In some cases this would otherwise cause the stone to warp across the screen and this feels very wrong.</p>
<p>Instead each stone will get a variable that tracks how much time it has used moving while inside a single step. For instance, if a stone would move 50 pixels this step, but it collides after moving 35 pixels, it still has 30% time left in this step. This time is then applied to the new speed and the stone is moved accordingly. At the end of the collision detection cycle, a stone will move the remaining time percentage of the speed it currently has to finish it&#8217;s move.</p>
<p>The side effect of this approach is on the one hand that the collisions look much smoother now. But it also means that collision chaining just became a heckuvalot more complex. Because now you have to keep checking for collisions and scan all the stones again after every collision. I&#8217;ve had cases where this meant considerate pauses. So it&#8217;s a good idea to arbitrarily cut this short. There&#8217;s no point in simulating 50 collisions this way. Remember that it&#8217;s all about the user. It only has to perceive to be correct.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a final demo with the entire physics engine at work.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kueMt/embedded/result" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve turned this engine into a plugin. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/bonsai-plugins/circle-physics">https://github.com/bonsai-plugins/circle-physics</a> and include it in your own projects. The Item class is exposed through the Phsyics constructor (so Physics.Item). I suggest subclassing that class.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Tuesday we released <a href="http://bonsaijs.org">bonsai</a> the light-weight JavaScript library, that makes creating visually rich content on the web easier than ever before, and yes it is inspired by Flash. It was a pretty big day for us, we had been working towards this for months now. Just a couple of weeks ago it was still named Bikeshed, it had almost no documentation and the demos were really just for internal use, but it was always driven by test driven development and we are pretty proud of that.</p>
<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Bonsai is nothing less than the heart of our Flash to HTML5 conversion service <a href="http://pixelplant.com">pixelplant</a>. Bonsai is <a href="http://github.com/uxebu/bonsai">open source</a> and released under the MIT license. Without bonsai there would be nothing ticking. Bonsai is the JavaScript library that does all the hard work and allows you to write really simple code to accomplish even complex things, such as (click the run-button at the upper right corner below):</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 500px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/X3dpJ/3/embedded/" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>We had been reshaping the API multiple times, from early on we had input from real users and now we are very confident that it has become consise and easy to use. As you can see there has been a lot of working going into little details such as manipulating the colors.<br />
Bonsai can roughly be separated into three big areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>content creation &#8211; which allows to create and/or load shapes, images, text, video, colors, gradients and audio soon too</li>
<li>organization &#8211; where you can group any kind of items, set them onto a timeline which can be used in sprites and movie clips</li>
<li>and manipulation &#8211; which consists of applying animations, matrices, filters and hook onto events that can be used to modify the behavior</li>
</ol>
<h1>How we got there</h1>
<p>When we started out we wanted to see results quickly and not prototype for an eterninty until we could try it out. Pure development had started in October and actually all the optical illusions for our <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/archive/">christmas bikeshed episodes</a> had been made with a very early version of bonsai (which still used to be bikeshed).</p>
<p>In order to get the API into our hands quickly we used <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">Raphaël</a> initially as the renderer below, so we didn&#8217;t have to worry about this part anymore and built purely the API. When the architecture and API reached a very useable state we replaced Raphaël with our own renderer, a SVG renderer. Besides the SVG renderer we decided for one very important detail early on too: our separation of the renderer and the runner.</p>
<p>The runner is the piece that does the heavy load, it executes the bonsai script you write, does all the calculations and generates a set of rendering messages, for each frame. The messages are requested by the renderer when it is done with the last set of messages, it then has no more to do than translating those messages into visible elements. The two are communicating over a simple protocol. Those two layers allow us to move the execution of all heavy calculations into the WebWorker and give the renderer all the execution time of the web page for rendering, since that is the thing that takes longest, especially on the current mobile devices. And no heavy calculation would hinder the rendering. On top we got for free to execute the runner on the server (in a nodejs process) and send only the rendering messages to the browser, which allows even multi player games served by one server process. The renderer itself has no more than 2000 lines of code that just uses SVG and soon Canvas, WebGL or any other technology for rendering any kind of visuals.</p>
<h1>Ready for production?</h1>
<p>Oh yes, you bet.</p>
<p>We are shipping bonsai already as part of our products and services. Of which <a href="http://pixelplant.com">pixelplant</a> is the most prominent one. It is running already for months.</p>
<p>Of course we are optimizing speed every day and trying to squeeze every last bit out of it, especially when we jump from our desktop development environment onto a mobile device, such as the iPad to test it out we see that there is lots that can be done.</p>
<h1>Thanks</h1>
<p>Thanks go out to all those that have been working hard to get bonsai out of the door, the entire uxebu crew and everyone who has helped us get it to where it is.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to all the input that we can get from the community and hope that everyone out there who is interested becomes productive quickly and has a fun time using what we built.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some might have heard of the decision we took last year in October, for others it might be new: We jumped into the deep end of the pool by deciding to spend all of our time on what we love doing most &#8211; building tools for the web, using technology of the web. It is an incredibly exciting time in the life of uxebu, so let me sum up a little bit why and how we took this somewhat crazy step.</p>
<p><strong>The uxebu incubator</strong></p>
<p>We always tried to make time available for other projects, open-source work and R&amp;D type of work. We pushed out a lot of cool stuff, such as <a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/2010/04/27/touchscroll-a-scrolling-layer-for-webkit-mobile">TouchScroll</a>, <a href="http://embedjs.org">EmbedJS</a>, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/01/26/found-footage-iphone-arduino-heartrate-monitor-humanapi/">HumanAPI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jensarps/StorageJS">StorageJS</a> and <a href="http://apparat.io">apparat.io</a>. We even were spinning around ideas of giving everybody at uxebu the option to seed-fund their own idea/startup from uxebu funds by creating an incubator. We never were really able though to launch something into its own life &#8211; customer projects did a great job sneaking themselfs into our other projects with sometimes too high priority &#8211; you probably know exactly how this feels <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
<span id="more-2363"></span><br />
<strong>Why switch?</strong></p>
<p>Back in our consultancy life, uxebu was doing pretty well, we had tons of fun, were able to travel, support the community and much more. So why would we ever even consider making the move? The answer is not a simple one, there were lots of facettes to it and a lot of gut feeling &#8211; but some of the things we talked about were following:</p>
<p><em>The team</em></p>
<p>We are incredibly lucky to have such an amazing team of talented, creative and great to be around people on board and it almost felt odd not to try to build something together, which could have impact on the development of the web &#8211; yes we had very cool customer projects, we did stuff which was difficult to solve, but it never quite felt like we as a team were working on achieving a common goal. By working on a single idea, we finally had the chance to work together with the whole team, which was not possible when working for customers.</p>
<p>Maybe this video by David Pfahler and Stephan Boennemann can give you some idea (see all videos <a href="http://bikeshed.uxebu.com/201112/">here</a>) <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jFWSMivP8wk?feature=player_detailpage" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em>It was really difficult, keeping customers and projects separate</em></p>
<p>We always tried to make as much time available as we could for working on open source projects, we even launched a product <a href="http://apparat.io">apparat.io</a>. apparat.io was the project which blatantly made clear to us that we were not able to move at a speed which we had in our minds &#8211; releases got delayed due to other more important deadlines, features got cut, ideas were dumped and in general, stuff happened about four times slower. It was painful because we saw the potential and failed to make it happen.</p>
<p><em>We couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about building our own &#8216;thing&#8217;</em></p>
<p>We wanted more and were hungry for building something for the long run, we wanted to get away from working on projects which would start and end again a few months later. At almost every hackcamp with the team (the only chance we all got to see each other were these events, since we all work remotely) the same discussion came up again and again. There were ideas for new products flying around and we just had to take the chance.</p>
<p><strong>The right idea</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tobeytailor">Tobias Schneider</a> started working on <a href="http://blip.tv/jsconf/tobias-schneider-flash-is-dead-long-live-flash-3834022">Gordon</a>, a Flash player written in 100% JavaScript, sometime in late 2009. We continued working on it with a team of four members in early 2011 and reached support for Flash 8 and AS2 in August 2011. The experience we&#8217;ve gathered along the way, building a Flash 8 / AS2 runtime in JavaScript, made us think about incorporating the work into the long term vision and mission of uxebu.</p>
<p><strong>Bikeshed was born</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2415" style="border: 2px solid #ccc; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" title="bikeshedicon" src="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bikeshedicon-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />There is a clear shift happening today in how <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">we can re-think building tools</a>, in our case tools for the web, built using web technology. There is an amazing amount of potential in creating tools, targeting mobile and touch devices first.</p>
<p>Because of fundamental changes in technology, we clearly see an opportunity to build better tools and help people to transform their ideas (for example a beautiful game, or animation) and thoughts into reality.</p>
<p>And with that we have set out the first two release milestones for the second quarter of 2012:</p>
<p><strong>Bikeshed Flash to HTML5 conversion</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2443" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" title="blvd" src="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blvd1-150x150.png" alt="" width="120" height="120" />The Flash to HTML5 conversion will allow you to convert Flash 9/10 and AS3 projects into HTML5. HTML5 which you will be able to reuse, change, adjust and even incorporate into new projects. The conversion will be an online service, so there is no need to install software &#8211; just upload your SWF and we give you HTML5.</p>
<p><strong>Bikeshed JS</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2450" style="border: 2px solid #fff; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" title="game" src="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game.png" alt="" width="200" height="150" />Bikeshed JS is a JavaScript graphics API, inspired by Flash (we hope we were able to take the good parts <img src="http://www.uxebu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), which will be open sourced under the MIT license as well as used in the converted Flash to HTML5 results. With Bikeshed JS you will be able to create beautiful and creative content for the web, such as games, animations, info-graphics, dashboards and much more.</p>
<p>So here we are today, in the middle of our first two major releases, our consultancy past feels like years away. We hope that you will find the stuff we&#8217;re working on useful, that we can inspire you to create beautiful content for the web and that our tools will take a tiny part in pushing the web forward.</p>
<p><a href="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/editor2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2469" style="border: 2px solid #fff; float: right; margin: 0 0 30px 20px;" title="editor" src="http://uxebu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/editor2-300x159.png" alt="" width="250" /></a>If you are curious, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/bikeshedjs">@bikeshedjs</a> and take a peek at <a href="http://bike.sh">http://bike.sh</a> in the future.</p>
<p>And until the release, sit back and watch some of the <a href="http://bike.sh/201112">videos we created over christmas 2011</a> :).</p>
