		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t able to get your exact solution to work as Google Spreadsheet kept putting a newline at the end of each line of the csv output, causing the script to break.  Instead, I created a spreadsheet where the first cell (A1) created an array variable, and then each subsequent row is assigned as a string to the array.  A column at the end has then end quote and semicolon, so each line is a standalone JS statement.  Then I used $.getScript (jQuery) to include that script into my page, and then was able to use the returned array variable just like I would have used a CSV file.   
 
The Google JSON didn&#039;t work so well for me either, I just wanted a CSV I could import, and what I ended up with was very close to perfect for my simple needs.  Hope that helps someone else struggling to do something like this. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our renters moved out a few months ago and left us having a mess to clean up. Not just were there holes within the wall, they also destroyed doors, window frames and carpets. They were incredibly smart and covered up the damage with pictures, posters and curtains so we didn&#039;t realize the extent from the damage until they were gone. Now we&#039;re fixing up the house so we can rent it again. Thankfully, this career is significantly easier as we have a laptop with wireless capabilities. We are capable to &lt;a href=&quot;//www.D2Surveys.com&#8221;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Get Free Diablo 2 Items Online.&lt;/a&gt; as well as other shows so we are entertained although toiling away. It is excellent that the Online offers issues of this nature. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the past nine days we are already snowed in. This has not been quite much fun as all seven kids can be found trapped inside the house with me for just a good deal with the time. It has been too cold for them to stay out for any length of time. To add to that, our electric keeps heading in and out. Whenever we do have electricity we charge the laptop battery. When the electricity goes out, we either play games, read or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.D2Surveys.com”&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Get Free Diablo 2 Items Online.&lt;/a&gt; thanks to our generator. I&#039;m glad we discovered the website where we can do this as it keeps everybody occupied and quiet. I imagine I miss the quiet most of all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dada ... inspired by Chris Heilmans talk about YQL at the WebMontag in Frankfurt two days ago, I simply tried it with YQL and it is muuuuch easier to use that for converting the spreadsheets output to JSONP.
The URL (including the YQL query) is the following: http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20csv%20where%20url%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fpub%3Fkey%3Drai4OXpsbS2Bc04lWn575ZA%26output%3Dcsv%27&amp;format=json&amp;callback=cbfunc
And you can get JSONP out of every spreadsheet :-)
Great, ha? Though the ideal solution would be google offering JSONP directly, but this workaround just makes it much easier than the solution I described above. Fortunately!
Have fun ...]]></description>
